  <p>Most of the territory and people of the modern <strong>French
      Republic</strong> (<em lang="fr">la République française</em>) are
      located in western Europe.</p>

  <p>The mainland of France, along with the island of Corsica, is
    usually referred to as <em>metropolitan France</em> or, more
    colloquially, “The Hexagon”
    (<em lang="fr">l'Hexagone</em>), after its shape.</p>

  <p>Like most of Britain, the dominant group in France before the
    Romans were the Celts. Unlike in Britain, however, except in the
    northwestern province of <em>Brittany</em>, little Celtic influence
    remains today.</p>

  <p>Most of modern France, known as <strong>Gaul</strong>, was under Roman rule
    for around five centuries, much longer than the Romans were in
    Britain. The French Celts were effectively “Romanized”
    by their rulers.</p>

  <p>The Roman language—both the written, classical Latin, and its
    unwritten “street language” vulgar Latin—had a
    lasting influence on France, shaping the precursor languages to
    modern French.</p>

  <p>After the fall of Rome, the Germanic <em>Franks</em> (for whom
    France is named) conquered most of modern France and placed it under
    their rule. Eventually most of western Europe was under one ruler,
    with Charlemagne crowned Holy Roman Emperor.</p>

  <p>Eventually the western third of Charlemagne's kingdom, known
    as <em>West Francia</em> at the time, was under the rule
    of <strong>Charles the Bald</strong>. However, like in Germany, eventually
    the land was fragmented between various rulers of varying loyalty
    to the nominal king.</p>

<p>The Kings of France over the centuries tried to extend full control
  from their power base in the <em lang="fr">Île de France</em>.</p>

<p>They were able to bring the nobles to heel; unlike in England, they
  did not have to compromise much, undermining
  the <strong>Estates-General</strong> and centralizing power in the royal court
  and bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Although there was an uprising of nobles around the time of the
  English Civil War, known as the <em lang="fr">Fronde</em>, it failed
  and royal power was strengthened. Feudalism in France gave way
  to <em>absolutism</em>.</p>

  <p>Arguably the height of the <em lang="fr">ancien régime</em> was
    under the rule of <span lang="fr">Louis XIV</span>, the “Sun
    King.” He began the construction of the famous Palace of
    Versailles, and imposed greater religious and political uniformity
    on his subjects.

  </p>
<p>Under his successor, and great-grandson, <span lang="fr">Louis
      XV</span>, royal power continued to remain strong. Unlike the
    Sun King, <span lang="fr">Louis XV</span> was deeply unpopular
    with most of his people, particularly after losing Canada to the

  <p>Although both <span lang="fr">Louis XV</span> and his

      reforms in line with the ideas of the French Enlightenment,
      their changes did not go far enough to please the radicals.

  </p>
<p>A need to reform the tax system in the wake of a second war
    against Britain—the American
    Revolution—led <span lang="fr">Louis XVI</span> to convene
    the Estates-General for the first time in over 170 years.</p>

  <p>The First Estate (clergy) and Second Estate (nobles) were joined
      by the commoners' Third Estate, who soon demanded that all three
      estates should constitute a single <strong>National Assembly</strong>,
      meeting as a single body. <span lang="fr">Louis XVI</span> soon
      bowed to the inevitable.</p>

  <p>At first, <span lang="fr">Louis XVI</span> and the National
    Assembly uneasily worked together, establishing a constitutional
    monarchy, with the king's power limited by the <em>Declaration of
      Rights</em> and the <em>Constitution of 1791</em>.</p>

    <p>However, in 1792 the king and his allies (including the king of
    Prussia and the Holy Roman Emperor) plotted to return power to
      royal hands, while the radical <em>Jacobins</em> demanded more radical
      reform, particularly to empower the working class.</p>

    <p>When the revolutionaries went to war against Austria-Hungary
      and Prussia, the Jacobins seized power in France, arrested the
      king, and declared France a republic.</p>

  <p>Convention replaced with a new bicameral legislature, with
    executive power vested in five-member body known as
    the <em>Directory</em>. In practice, it governed as a dictatorship.

  </p>
<p>Although it lasted four years, the Directory was
    ineffective and unpopular. In 1799,
    General <span lang="fr">Napoléon Bonaparte</span> launched the
    <em>coup of 18 Brumaire</em>, which unseated the Directory and
    replaced it with the three-member <em>Consulate</em>, with himself

  <p>For a time, he and his armies were wildly successful in

  <p>In 1851, after failing to have the constitution amended in a
    referendum to allow him to seek a second term of office, he and
    his supporters organized a “self-coup,” dissolving
    parliament. A referendum was organized to validate the coup, and
    the next year a second referendum established the <em>Second Empire</em>,
    with <span lang="fr">Louis-Napoléon</span> now installed
    as <span lang="fr">Napoléon III</span>.</p>

  <p>Although <span lang="fr">Napoléon III</span> initially ruled in a

    overall the Second Empire was a period of relative prosperity for
    France.</p>

  <p>However, unlike his uncle, <span lang="fr">Napoléon III</span>
    had only limited battlefield prowess. The Prussian

    the <strong>Franco-Prussian War</strong>.</p>

  <p>The German defeat left another power vacuum in France. A new
    national assembly was soon elected, but it came into conflict with
    Parisian radicals who formed the <em>Paris Commune</em>. The new
    parliamentary <strong>Third Republic</strong>, however, brought genuine mass
    democracy to France.</p>

  <p>Internally the republic was divided politically. Some French
    sought the restoration of the monarchy, while others thought the
    republic insufficiently radical. Between 1870 and 1940, France
    averaged more than one prime minister per <em>year</em>.</p>

  <p>When France was liberated by the Allies, a <em>provisional

  <p>Typically deputies serve a five-year term. The president can
  dismiss them and call early elections, but the 2000 reforms make
  this less likely.</p>

  <p>The Assembly meets at the <strong lang="fr">Palais

  <p>Assembly deputies, like presidents, are elected using a two-round
    system; if no candidate wins a majority in the first round, those
    candidates receiving at least 12.5% of the registered voters' votes
    proceed to a run-off, where whoever gets most votes prevails.</p>

  <p>Like in Britain, it is unusual for a proposal from the cabinet to
    be turned down by the National Assembly. If necessary, the prime
    minister can tie any proposed law to a censure vote; if the law
    fails, the cabinet falls.</p>

  <p>Unlike in the UK and Germany, deputies may not simultaneously
    serve as ministers in the government; instead, they must resign
    from the National Assembly and are replaced by an alternate from
    their party.</p>

  <p>The French Senate (<em lang="fr">Sénat</em>) is relatively weak,
    much like the British House of Lords. Its members are elected
    indirectly by members of local and regional governments, along with
    the members of the National Assembly.</p>

  <p>Since 2011, there have been 348 members elected to six-year
  terms; half of the members are chosen every three years.</p>

  <p>Senators can delay or amend legislation, but cannot ultimately
  block it.</p>

  <p>The Senate meets at the Luxembourg Palace in Paris.</p>

<p>Another important body in France is the <strong>Constitutional
Council</strong> (<em lang="fr">Conseil Constitutionnel</em>). Unlike
in the U.S. or Germany, it is not a <em>court of law</em>, but it does
have limited power to decide the constitutionality of laws.</p>

<p>Normally it decides whether or not a law is
constitutional <em>before</em> it goes into effect. However, since
2010 it has also had the power to review laws <em>after</em> they are
adopted.</p>

<p>Nine members are appointed for nine-year terms to the council by
the president, speaker of the Assembly, and speaker of the Senate. In
addition, former presidents are entitled to serve on the council for
life.</p>

  <p>France's party system has become increasingly unstable in recent
  years. Traditionally the two main blocs in French politics were:</p>

  <ul>
    <img src="img/cp03-france/640px-election-posters.jpg" style="float: right; width: 35%" alt="2012 election posters">

    <li><p><strong>The Republicans</strong> (<em lang="fr">Les

      Popular Movement</strong> (UMP); “neo-Gaullists”: conservative
      but not necessarily “free marketeers.”</p></li>

  <p>However, new political movements have eroded the traditional
    support bases for both parties.</p>

  <p>France was first divided into <em lang="fr">départements</em>
  during the revolutionary era in 1790, replacing the older
  provinces. They have been reorganized over the years.</p>

  <p>Since 2021, metropolitan France (including Corsica) has

  <p>Power in France is highly

  government is represented by a <strong>prefect</strong>
  (<em lang="fr">préfet</em>) who directs the local police and
  oversees the local elected officials.</p>

  run by bureaucrats appointed by the central government with little

  <p>The centralized French state is also heavily bureaucratic, even
  by European standards.</p>

  <p>In the post-war era, French bureaucrats steered industry—both
  nationalized and private—through a system known
  as <em lang="fr">dirigisme</em> using <em>indicative planning</em>
  to try to direct investment in production based on expert
  judgment.</p>

  <p>Most bureaucrats attended the <em lang="fr">grandes écoles</em>,
  especially the <em lang="fr">École Nationale d'Administration</em>
  (ENA) in Strasbourg.</p>

  <p><em lang="fr">Énarques</em> often pass between electoral politics
  and the bureaucracy due to rules that encourage this “revolving
  door.”</p>

<p>Post-war <em lang="fr">dirigiste</em> policies led to creation of
  “national champions,” both in the private and
  nationalized sectors.</p>


<p>Privatization was initiated in France under socialist government
  of <span lang="fr">François Mitterand</span> in the 1980s. But not
  as complete as in the UK, since state investment is much deeper and
  free-market ideology is less popular.</p>

<p>French labor market has high costs and low flexibility, leading to
  high unemployment, particularly for youth.</p>

<p>France has a much bigger agricultural sector than most
  industrialized countries, affecting politics by strengthening the
  interests of rural France.</p>
