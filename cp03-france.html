  <h2>Geography</h2>
  <img src="img/cp03-france/Fr-map.png"
       style="float: right; width: 40%">

  <p>Most of the territory and people of the modern <b>French
      Republic</b> (<i lang="fr">la République française</i>) is located
    in western Europe.</p>

  <p>The mainland of France, along with the island of Corsica, is
    usually referred to as <i>metropolitan France</i> or, more
    colloquially, &ldquo;The Hexagon&rdquo;
    (<i lang="fr">l'Hexagone</i>), after its shape.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Early History</h2>

  <p>Like most of Britain, the dominant group in France before the
    Romans were the Celts. Unlike in Britain, however, except in the
    northwestern province of <i>Brittany</i>, little Celtic influence
    remains today.</p>

  <p>Most of modern France, known as <b>Gaul</b>, was under Roman rule
    for around five centuries, much longer than the Romans were in
    Britain. The French Celts were effectively &ldquo;Romanized&rdquo;
    by their rulers.</p>

  <p>The Roman language&mdash;both the written, classical Latin, and its
    unwritten &ldquo;street language&rdquo; vulgar Latin&mdash;had a
    lasting influence on France, shaping the precursor languages to
    modern French.</p>

  <h2>Charlemagne and West Francia</h2>

  <img src="img/cp03-france/608px-Western_empire_verdun_843.png"
       alt="Map of the division of Charlemagne's empire in 843 AD"
       style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>After the fall of Rome, the Germanic <i>Franks</i> (for whom
    France is named) conquered most of modern France and placed it under
    their rule. Eventually most of western Europe was under one ruler,
    with Charlemagne crowned Holy Roman Emperor.</p>
  
  <p>Eventually the western third of Charlemagne's kingdom, known
    as <em>West Francia</em> at the time, was under the rule
    of <b>Charles the Bald</b>. However, like in Germany, eventually
    the land was fragmented between various rulers of varying loyalty
    to the nominal king.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Absolutism</h2>

<img src="img/cp03-france/Map_France_1477-en.svg"
     style="float: right; width: 30%" alt="France in 1477.">

<p>The Kings of France over the centuries tried to extend full control
  from their power base in the <i lang="fr">Île de France</i>.</p>

<p>They were able to bring the nobles to heel; unlike in England, they
  did not have to compromise much, undermining
  the <b>Estates-General</b> and centralizing power in the royal court
  and bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Although there was an uprising of nobles around the time of the
  English Civil War, known as the <i lang="fr">Fronde</i>, it failed
  and royal power was strengthened. Feudalism in France gave way
  to <i>absolutism</i>.</p>

  <img src="img/cp03-france/640px-Versailles_chateau.jpg"
       alt="The Palace of Versailles"
       style="float: right; width: 40%">

  <p>Arguably the height of the <i lang="fr">ancien régime</i> was
    under the rule of <span lang="fr">Louis XIV</span>, the “Sun
    King.” He began the construction of the famous Palace of
    Versailles, and imposed greater religious and political uniformity
    on his subjects.
    
  <p>Under his successor, and great-grandson, <span lang="fr">Louis
      XV</span>, royal power continued to remain strong. Unlike the
    Sun King, <span lang="fr">Louis XV</span> was deeply unpopular
    with most of his people, particularly after losing Canada to the
    British.</p>

  <h2>Prelude to Revolution</h2>

  <img src="img/cp03-france/Estatesgeneral.jpg"
       alt="Opening of the meeting of the Estates-General in 1789."
       style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>Although both <span lang="fr">Louis XV</span> and his
      grandson <span lang="fr">Louis XVI</span> implemented some
      reforms in line with the ideas of the French Enlightenment,
      their changes did not go far enough to please the radicals.

  <p>A need to reform the tax system in the wake of a second war
    against Britain&mdash;the American
    Revolution&mdash;led <span lang="fr">Louis XVI</span> to convene
    the Estates-General for the first time in over 170 years.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>1789: The French Revolution</h2>

  <p>The First Estate (clergy) and Second Estate (nobles) were joined
      by the commoners' Third Estate, who soon demanded that all three
      estates should constitute a single <b>National Assembly</b>,
      meeting as a single body. <span lang="fr">Louis XVI</span> soon
      bowed to the inevitable.</p>

  <p>At first, <span lang="fr">Louis XVI</span> and the National
    Assembly uneasily worked together, establishing a constitutional
    monarchy, with the king's power limited by the <i>Declaration of
      Rights</i> and the <i>Constitution of 1791</i>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Plots and Counter-Plots</h2>

    <p>However, in 1792 the king and his allies (including the king of
    Prussia and the Holy Roman Emperor) plotted to return power to
      royal hands, while the radical <i>Jacobins</i> demanded more radical
      reform, particularly to empower the working class.</p>

    <p>When the revolutionaries went to war against Austria-Hungary
      and Prussia, the Jacobins seized power in France, arrested the
      king, and declared France a republic.</p>

  <h2>The Directory and the Consulate</h2>

 <img src="img/cp03-france/578px-3consuls.jpg" alt="The Three Consuls"
      style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>Convention replaced with a new bicameral legislature, with
    executive power vested in five-member body known as
    the <i>Directory</i>. In practice, it governed as a dictatorship.

  <p>Although it lasted four years, the Directory was
    ineffective and unpopular. In 1799,
    General <span lang="fr">Napoléon Bonaparte</span> launched the
    <i>coup of 18 Brumaire</i>, which unseated the Directory and
    replaced it with the three-member <i>Consulate</i>, with himself
    serving as First Consul. This event effectively ended the
    revolutionary era in France.</p>

  <p><span lang="fr">Napoléon</span> ruled as a dictator or uncrowned
    king. He had himself named consul-for-life in 1802, and in 1804,
    he dispensed with the <i>uncrowned</i> part and had himself
    proclaimed emperor.</p>

  <p>For a time, he and his armies were wildly successful in
    controlling much of Europe, directly or indirectly. But eventually
    his enemies turned the tide and <span lang="fr">Napoléon</span>
    was defeated and sent into exile in 1814 (although he staged a
    brief comeback the following year).</p>

  <p><span lang="fr">Napoléon</span>'s
    nephew, <i lang="fr">Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte</i>, was soon elected
    as president. He declared himself &ldquo;Prince-President&rdquo; and
    emulated the militarist trappings of his uncle.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Second Empire</h2>

  <p>In 1851, after failing to have the constitution amended in a
    referendum to allow him to seek a second term of office, he and
    his supporters organized a &ldquo;self-coup,&rdquo; dissolving
    parliament. A referendum was organized to validate the coup, and
    the next year a second referendum established the <i>Second Empire</i>,
    with <span lang="fr">Louis-Napoléon</span> now installed
    as <span lang="fr">Napoléon III</span>.</p>

  <p>Although <span lang="fr">Napoléon III</span> initially ruled in a
    dictatorial manner, his regime became more liberal in the 1860s, and
    overall the Second Empire was a period of relative prosperity for
    France.</p>

  <h2>The End of the Empire</h2>

  <img src="img/cp03-france/361px-Alsace-lorraine.jpg"
       style="float: right; width: 30%" alt="Louis-Napoléon">

  <p>However, unlike his uncle, <span lang="fr">Napoléon III</span>
    had only limited battlefield prowess. The Prussian
    chancellor, <span lang="de">Otto von Bismarck</span>, drew France
    into his scheme to unify Germany under Prussian rule, resulting in
    the <b>Franco-Prussian War</b>.</p>

  <p>The war proved a humiliating defeat for France
    and <span lang="fr">Napoléon III</span> in particular, who was
    captured by the Germans.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Third Republic</h2>

  <p>The German defeat left another power vacuum in France. A new
    national assembly was soon elected, but it came into conflict with
    Parisian radicals who formed the <i>Paris Commune</i>. The new
    parliamentary <b>Third Republic</b>, however, brought genuine mass
    democracy to France.</p>

  <p>Internally the republic was divided politically. Some French
    sought the restoration of the monarchy, while others thought the
    republic insufficiently radical. Between 1870 and 1940, France
    averaged more than one prime minister per <i>year</i>.</p>

    <img src="img/cp03-france/France_map_Lambert-93_with_regions_and_departments-occupation.svg"
       style="float: right; width: 35%" alt="The Occupation">

  <p>After Germany's swift conquest of France, the
    collaborationist <i>Vichy regime</i> was established. Although the
    Vichy government was nominally in charge of most of France, the
    north and west were placed under German occupation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Occupation</h2>

  <p>Many French people supported the Vichy regime, either due to
    its anti-communist orientation or its relative stability.</p>

  <p>Other French people joined the anti-German
    <i lang="fr">Résistance</i>, while many of those who had
    successfully fled ahead of the German invasion joined the <b>Free
    French</b> forces in Britain under General <span lang="fr">Charles
      de Gaulle</span>.</p>

<section>
  <h2>The Fourth Republic</h2>

  <p>When France was liberated by the Allies, a <i>provisional
      government</i> was established to prepare for a new post-war
    constitution, which established the <b>Fourth Republic</b>.</p>

  <p>In many ways, the Fourth Republic was a continuation of the Third
    Republic. Although its constitution was designed to produce more
    stable governments, in practice it didn't.</p>

  <h2>The Algerian Crisis</h2>

  <img src="img/cp03-france/Algeria_France_Locator.png"
       alt="Map showing locations of France and Algeria"
       style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>The downfall of the Fourth Republic was the crisis in Algeria.
    The French colony in North Africa was divided between the native
    Algerians and French settlers (<i lang="fr">pieds-noirs</i>).</p>

  <p>To forestall any withdrawal from
    Algeria, <a href="http://ezproxy.mga.edu/login?url=http://digital.films.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?aid=27469&amp;xtid=38273">the
    army staged a <i lang="fr">coup d'état</i> against the
    government</a>. They took over Algeria and Corsica and warned the
    government that Paris would be next if <span lang="fr">Charles de
    Gaulle</span> was not installed as prime minister.</p>

<section>
  <h2>The Fifth Republic</h2>

  <img src="img/cp03-france/De_Gaulle-OWI.jpg"
       style="float: right; width: 20%" alt="Charles de Gaulle">

  <p>

  <p><span lang="fr">Charles de Gaulle</span> returned from his
    retirement from politics and promptly consolidated power in his
    own hands. He and his allies drafted a new constitution
    strengthening the presidency at the expense of parliament.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he did not want a system with as many <i>checks
    and balances</i> as the U.S.-style presidential system.</p>

  <p>The new constitution established what is known as
    a <b>semipresidential</b> or <b>premier-presidential</b>
    system.</p>

  <h2>President of the Republic</h2>

  <img src="img/cp03-france/600px-Emmanuel_Macron_crop.jpg"
       style="float: right; width: 25%" alt="Emmanuel Macron; By Ecole polytechnique Université Paris - https://www.flickr.com/photos/117994717@N06/23417806279/, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=57454617">

  <p>Presidents are elected by the voters to five-year terms, using
    a <i>majority-runoff</i> system; if no candidate gets an absolute
    majority of the vote, the top two candidates face off in a second
    round two weeks after the election.</p>

  <p>Currently, presidents cannot serve more than two consecutive terms.</p>

  <p>The current president of France is <span lang="fr">Emmanuel
    Macron</span> of the <i lang="fr">En Marche!</i> (Forward!)
    political movement, who was elected in May 2017.</p>

  <h2>The Government</h2>

       style="float: right; width: 22.5%" alt="">
  -->

  <p>Under the French semipresidential system, the prime minister and
    cabinet are chosen by the <i>president</i>, not parliament.</p>

  <p>However, the parliament can <b>censure</b> the government; if
    this happens, the president must appoint a new cabinet. This
    effectively means that the president must choose a cabinet that
    will command the support of a majority in parliament.</p>

  <p>The current prime minister has been <span lang="fr">Édouard
      Philippe</span> of the Republicans (LR), since May 2017.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2 lang="fr">Cohabitation</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><p><i lang="fr">Cohabitation</i> is term used when president
        is from a different party than that with a majority in
        parliament.</p></li>

    <li><p>To avoid censure votes, president had to appoint prime
        ministers and cabinets preferred by the majority party. Prime
        ministers had more real power than the president in these
        circumstances.</p></li>

    <li><p>In 2000, the constitution was amended to make presidential
        and parliamentary terms coincide and to hold their elections
        within a few weeks of each other, making
        <span lang="fr">cohabitation</span> less likely in the
        future.</p></li>

<section>
  <h2>The National Assembly</h2>

  <img src="img/cp03-france/640px-Panorama_de_lhemicyle_de_lassemblee_nationale.jpg"
       style="float: right; width: 45%" alt="Assembly chamber">

  <p>The National Assembly (<i lang="fr">Assemblée nationale</i>) is
    the lower house of the French parliament.</p>

  <p>The 577 <i lang="fr">députés</i> are elected from single-member
    districts, including seats for overseas territories and for French
    citizens living abroad.</p>

  <p>Typically deputies serve a five-year term. The president can
    dismiss them and call early elections, but the 2000 reforms
    make this less likely.</p>

  <p>The Assembly meets at the <b lang="fr">Palais Bourbon</b> in Paris.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>More on the Assembly</h2>

  <p>Assembly deputies, like presidents, are elected using a
    two-round system; if no candidate wins a majority in the first
    round, those candidates receiving at least 12.5% of the registered
    voters' votes proceed to a run-off, where whoever gets most votes
    prevails.</p>

  <p>Like in Britain, it is unusual for a proposal from the cabinet to
    be turned down by the National Assembly. If necessary, the prime
    minister can tie any proposed law to a censure vote; if the law
    fails, the cabinet falls.</p>

  <p>Unlike in the UK and Germany, deputies may not simultaneously
    serve as ministers in the government; instead, they must resign from
    the National Assembly and are replaced by an alternate from their party.

  <h2>The Senate</h2>

  <img src="img/cp03-france/640px-Hemicycle_Senat_France.jpg"
       style="float: right; width: 22.5%" alt="Senate chamber">

  <p>The French Senate (<i lang="fr">Sénat</i>) is relatively weak,
    much like the British House of Lords. Its members are elected
    indirectly by members of local and regional governments, along
    with the members of the National Assembly.</p>

  <p>Since 2011, there have been 348 members elected to six-year
    terms; half of the members are chosen every three years.</p>

  <p>Senators can delay or amend legislation, but cannot ultimately
    block it.</p>

  <p>The Senate meets at the Luxembourg Palace in Paris.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>The Constitutional Council</h2>

<p>Another important body in France is the <b>Constitutional
    Council</b> (<i lang="fr">Conseil Constitutionnel</i>). Unlike in
  the U.S. or Germany, it is not a <i>court of law</i>, but it does
  have limited power to decide the constitutionality of laws.</p>

<p>Normally it decides whether or not a law is
  constitutional <i>before</i> it goes into effect. However, since
  2010 it has also had the power to review laws <i>after</i> they are
  adopted.</p>

  <p>Nine members are appointed for nine-year terms to the council by
  the president, speaker of the Assembly, and speaker of the
  Senate. In addition, former presidents are entitled to serve on the
  council for life.</p>

  <p>Power in France is highly
    centralized. Although <i lang="fr">départements</i> and their
    subdivisions have elected councils and mayors, the national
    government is represented by a <b>prefect</b>
    (<i lang="fr">préfet</i>) who directs the local police and
    oversees the local elected officials.

  <p>Many other functions of government, like public education, are
    run by bureaucrats appointed by the central government with little
    or no local oversight.</p>

  <h2>French Cultural Divisions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><p>The <i>secular&ndash;clerical divide</i>
      (<i lang="fr">laïcité</i>): debate over the role of the Catholic
      Church; how strictly separated should church and state
      be?</p></li>

  <li><p><i>Patriotism and distrust of government</i>: the French have
      a strong sense of nationalism but are highly cynical about
      government officials.</p></li>

  <li><p><i>Education is both egalitarian and elitist</i>: there are
      more places in academic high schools (<i lang="fr">lycées
      générals</i>) than in Germany's <i lang="de">Gymnasien</i>, and
      their graduates automatically qualify for university
      education&mdash;but the elite schools (<i lang="fr">grandes
      écoles</i>) like <i>ENA</i> are highly selective.</p></li>

</ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Government by Bureaucracy</h2>

  <p>The centralized French state is also heavily bureaucratic, even
  by European standards.

  <p>In the post-war era, French bureaucrats steered
    industry&mdash;both nationalized and private&mdash;through a
    system known as <i lang="fr">dirigisme</i> using <i>indicative
    planning</i> to try to direct investment in production based on
    expert judgment.

  <p>Most bureaucrats attended the <i lang="fr">grandes écoles</i>,
      especially the <i lang="fr">École Nationale d'Administration</i>
      (ENA) in Strasbourg.

  <p><i lang="fr">Énarques</i> often pass between electoral politics
  and the bureaucracy due to rules that encourage this “revolving
  door.”

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The French Economy</h2>

<p>Post-war <i lang="fr">dirigiste</i> policies led to creation of
  &ldquo;national champions,&rdquo; both in the private and
  nationalized sectors.

<p>Privatization was initiated in France under socialist government
  of <span lang="fr">François Mitterand</span> in the 1980s. But not
  as complete as in the UK, since state investment is much deeper and
  free-market ideology is less popular.

<p>French labor market has high costs and low flexibility, leading to
  high unemployment, particularly for youth.

<p>France has a much bigger agricultural sector than most
  industrialized countries, affecting politics by strengthening
  the interests of rural France.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Immigration, Race, and Religion</h2>

<ul>

  <li><p>France's colonial legacy, particularly in Algeria, means
    France has a lot of immigrants from Africa; many are Muslim and
      poorly integrated into French society.</p></li>

  <li><p>A distinct Muslim identity is at odds with French republican
      ideal of <i lang="fr">laïcité</i> (strict separation of religion
      and state).</p></li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Europe</h2>

  <ul>
    <img src="img/cp03-france/Flag_of_Europe.svg" alt="Flag of Europe."
         style="float: right; width: 30%; border: 0">

  <li>France is the biggest beneficiary of the <i>Common Agricultural
      Policy</i>, subsidizing French farmers (largely with German
      taxes). Historically France has been the E.U.'s biggest
      cheerleader&mdash;<span lang="fr">Jean Monnet</span>, the
      &ldquo;founding father&rdquo; of the E.U., was French.

  <li><p>However, French voters sometimes worry about loss of France's
      sovereignty to European institutions and dislike the politicians
      and bureaucrats who run the E.U.</p></li>
