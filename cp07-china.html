  <p><strong>China</strong> (officially, the <strong>People's Republic of China</strong>)
    is the most populous country in the world, with approximately 1.35
    billion people, occupying most of East Asia.</p>

  <p>Mainland China also claims the island of Taiwan as part of its
    territory; however, Taiwan and some neighboring islands are
    governed today by the <em>Republic of China</em> (ROC)
    government.</p>

  <h2>Chinese Language</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-02.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>The dominant language in China is known as <em>Mandarin
      Chinese</em>; the standard dialect is based on that of the
    capital city, Beijing.

  </p>
<p>However, spoken Chinese has many other varieties as
    well; <em>Cantonese</em> is the dominant language in southern China
    and is a common language among the overseas Chinese community.

  </p>
<p>Chinese is typically written using Chinese characters (also known
    as <em>Han</em> characters), which combine aspects of the meaning
    and sound of words. These characters are also used in Japanese
    writing and, to a lesser extent, in Korea.</p>

  <h2>Romanization</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-03.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Chinese is often transcribed (<em>romanized</em>) into the
    Latin alphabet using the <em>Pinyin</em> system, although Pinyin is
    mostly used in China as a teaching tool or to type Chinese
    words.

  </p>
<p>Pinyin is based on the Mandarin spoken language, and some letters
    don't correspond well to how English-speakers use them. For
    example, Pinyin ‘j,’ ‘q,’ and
    ‘x’ are variations of the English ‘ch’ and
    ‘sh’ sounds.</p>

  <p>Historically, there were other ways to transcribe Chinese; many
    Chinese places are or were commonly known in English using
    different romanization systems—examples include Peking (now
    Beijing) and Canton (now Guangzhou).

  <h2>Early History</h2>

    <img src="img/cp07-china/Qin_map.jpg" class="noborder" style="width: 30%; float: right" alt="Map of the Qin empire.">

  <p>The earliest Chinese kingdoms developed along the Yellow River
    around 4,000 years ago.

  </p>
<p>Over the centuries, as the population grew and spread out, China
    became divided into a large number of warring kingdoms.

  </p>
<p>The first real unified Chinese kingdom, known as the <em>Middle
      Kingdom</em>, emerged around 221 B.C. under
      the <em lang="zh-Latn">Qín</em> dynasty.

</p></section>

  <h2>The Han Dynasty</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-05.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>After the <span lang="zh-Latn">Qín</span> fell in 206 B.C.,
    the <em lang="zh-Latn">Hàn</em> dynasty arose and controlled most of
    China for the next four centuries.

  </p>
<p>The Han gradually replaced the feudalistic, aristocratic culture
    of China with a more centralized, bureaucratic culture, based on the
    ideas of Confucianism. The civil servants formed a social class at
    the top of Han society known as the <em>Mandarins</em>, and were
    selected by competitive examinations.

  </p>
<p>Although the Han dynasty wasn't China's longest, its influence
    remains even today; the dominant ethnic group in China are known as
    the Han, and China remains a heavily bureaucratic state strongly
    influenced by Confucian values.

</p></section>

  <h2>Dynastic Cycles</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-06.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>After the Han, a series of other dynasties ruled China, in whole
    or in part; they continued the practices of the Han. Even invading
    rulers were assimilated into the dynastic system.

  </p>
<p>Chinese people believed that the rise and fall of the various
    empires reflected the <em>Mandate of Heaven</em>: wise and virtuous
    rulers succeed because they had followed the will of heaven, while
    despotic or weak rulers had lost their way and were no longer
    worthy to rule.

  </p>
<p>Unlike the European concept of <em>divine right</em>, the Chinese
    did not see the Mandate of Heaven to be <em>carte blanche</em> for
    rulers to govern as they pleased.

</p></section>

  <h2>The Ming Dynasty</h2>

</audio>

  <p>The Ming dynasty ruled China from 1368 to 1644. Under the Ming,
    arguably China reached its height of power, even sending ships on
    voyages of exploration around the Indian Ocean; around 1500, China
    was more technologically advanced than Europe.

  </p>
<p>However, the Chinese rulers grew complacent and had limited
    interest in the outside world. The Chinese lost interest in
    expanding their territories and their economy.</p>

  <h2>The Qing and Rising European Influence</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-08.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Against this backdrop of decline, European explorers and
    merchants began to seek trade and influence in China. Rather than
    relating to Europeans on their own terms as they might have a few
    centuries earlier, the Chinese would meet their European rivals
    from an inferior position, particularly under the
    last, <em>Qing</em> dynasty.

  <h2>The First Opium War</h2>

</audio>

  <p>The first major humiliation of China came at the hands of the
    British in the <strong>First Opium War</strong> (1839–42).  Britain
    had found a ready Chinese market for opium being grown in India,
    even though opium smoking was illegal. When the Chinese
    authorities tried to stop the British from selling opium to its
    citizens by seizing several million pounds of it, the British
    objected and went to war.

  </p>
<p>The Qing were easily defeated, and Britain demanded the cession
    of the port of Hong Kong and the opening of five other Chinese
    ports to European trade, along with special privileges for
    European citizens in China.</p>

<section>
  <h2>The Second Opium War</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-10.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>The <strong>Second Opium War</strong> (1856–60) went even worse for
  China. Several imperial palaces were destroyed, additional ports
  were opened to European trade and Hong Kong was expanded, and the
  Chinese were forced to recognize Britain, France, and Russia as
  diplomatic equals by hosting embassies from those states.

</p></section>

  <h2>Imperial Collapse</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-11.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>The defeats at the hands of the European powers led to internal
    rebellions, further weakening the Qing dynasty. Japan took
    advantage of China's weakness, seizing Taiwan in 1894 and gaining
    influence over Korea at the expense of China.

  </p>
<p>Within China, foreigners—particularly Christian
    missionaries—became a target for popular anger. In 1900,
    participants in the <strong>Boxer Rebellion</strong> attacked both
    missionaries and Chinese converts, with support from some elements
    of the Chinese government. The European powers, along with the
    United States, intervened to put down the rebellion and extract
    reparations.

  <h2>The Republic</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-12.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>In 1911, the Qing dynasty was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen (Pinyin:
    <em lang="zh-Latn">Sūn Yìxiān</em>), who was a Western-trained
    doctor, aided by other revolutionaries among the military and
    government.

  </p>
<p>They established the <strong>Republic of China</strong> in the empire's
    place, and Sun founded the Chinese Nationalist Party or Kuomintang
    (KMT; Pinyin: <em lang="zh-Latn">Guómíndǎng</em>).

  </p>
<p>However, China descended into chaos in 1916 as various warlords
  fought the central government for control of the country. For the
  next decade, the KMT fought to reunify China.

</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>The Communists</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-13.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Early on, the KMT had support from the Soviet communists; the KMT
    was organized along Leninist lines (<em>democratic centralism</em>),
    and the KMT were taught propaganda techniques by Bolshevik
    advisers. The KMT included both left-wing and right-wing elements.

  </p>
<p>However, there was also an indigenous Communist Party of China
    (CCP), founded in 1921. The CCP and KMT cooperated during the
    conflict with the warlords, until 1927 when the KMT—led
    after the death of Sun Yat-sen by right-winger Chiang
    Kai-shek—expelled communists from his party.</p>

  <h2>The Long March</h2>

</audio>

  <p>Although the KMT gained control of most of the country by 1928,
  they were unable to eradicate the CCP, who went on the “Long
  March” in 1934 into the northwest of China to escape being
  encircled and captured by the KMT army. The Long March
  left <span lang="zh-Latn">Máo Zédōng</span> as the undisputed leader
  of the Communists.

  <h2>War with Japan</h2>

  <img src="img/cp07-china/Manchukuo_map_1939.svg" alt="Japanese conquests in East Asia during World War II." style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>The invasion of China by Japan in 1937 forced the Nationalists
    and the Communists to cooperate again. Japan had already invaded and
    taken over Manchuria (<em>Manchukuo</em>) in 1931, but the KMT had not
    put up much resistance as they saw the Communists as a greater
    threat than Japan.</p>

  <p>For the next eight years, the Communists and Nationalists fought
    on the same side against the Japanese, although they did not really
    work together; the KMT tended to apply conventional warfare while
    the CCP's forces favored guerrilla warfare. At times, they even
    fought each other for control of the inland areas of “free
    China.”</p>

  <h2>The Communist Victory</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-china/cp-china-16.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>After the Japanese were defeated in 1945, the civil war soon
    resumed. Although the Nationalists had a better-organized military
    and superior equipment, the Communists had more popular support and
    were able to seize key military assets they could use in the war.</p>

  <p>By the end of 1949, the KMT was effectively defeated on the
    mainland, and the Nationalist leadership “temporarily”
    relocated to Taiwan to continue the fight from there.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on October 1, 1949, the Communists declared the
    establishment of the <em>People's Republic of China</em>, with its
    capital in Beijing.</p>

    <img src="img/cp07-china/363px-Mao_Zedong_portrait.jpg" style="float: right; width: 20%" alt="Official portrait of Mao Zedong.">

  <p>Like in the Soviet Union, Mao had to decide how to adapt
    socialism to China. China in 1949 had a huge population outside
    the cities reliant on subsistence agriculture and barely any heavy
    industry.

  </p>
<p>In the first decade, <em>land reform</em> was the major emphasis of
    the regime. China's involvement in the Korean War (1950–53)
    in support of the North Korean regime of <span lang="ko-Latn">Kim
    Il-sung</span> proved costly in manpower and resources, slowing
    Mao's program of nationalization.

  <img src="img/cp07-china/Backyard_furnace4.jpg" style="float: right; width: 20%" alt="Backyard furnaces in rural China during the Great Leap Forward.">

  <p>From 1958 to 1961, Mao led the country on a radical restructuring
    known as the <strong>Great Leap Forward</strong>, because he felt the
    development of socialism was progressing too slowly and Soviet
    support was declining.

  </p>
<p>The Great Leap Forward included the forced collectivization of
    agriculture along with the rejection of old religious and cultural
    practices. Critics within and outside the Party were
    purged in the <em>Anti-Rightist Campaign</em>.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Effects of the Great Leap Forward</h2>

</audio>

  <p>The effects of the Great Leap Forward were as disastrous as Stalin's
    similar policies in the USSR had been. Between 30–45 million
    peasants died from starvation, in part due to a bizarre fixation
    on steel production in “backyard furnaces” at
    the expense of farming.

  </p>
<p>Mao was somewhat discredited by the failure of the Great Leap
    Forward, which allowed more moderate figures like <strong>Deng
      Xiaoping</strong> to advance into leadership positions.

  <p>Within a few years, Mao tried to revitalize Maoist thought in
    the <strong>Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution</strong> (1966–76).

  </p>
<p>During the Cultural Revolution, gangs of youth were organized
    into the <em>Red Guard</em>, who were used to persecute
    “revisionists” and anyone else who represented the
    Four Olds: “old ideas, culture, customs, and habits”
    of the bourgeoisie.

  </p>
<p>The targets of the Red Guards were wide-ranging: academics,
    doctors, farmers, and factory supervisors. Even party leaders were
    not immune; Deng was among those purged from the party leadership
    (twice).</p>

  <p>The Cultural Revolution ended with Mao's death and the ouster of
    the <em>Gang of Four</em> in 1976. The new party leader, Hua
    Guofeng, restored Deng to his senior party positions.</p>

  <p>Deng successfully outmaneuvered Hua to gain control of the party
    and the country. He embarked on a program of capitalist economic
    reform—euphemistically called “socialism with Chinese
    characteristics”—and improving ties with other countries,
    particularly the United States.</p>

  <p>Deng also was responsible for suppressing the Tiananmen Square
    protests of 1989. Although the CCP is willing to promote greater
    economic openness, substantial political reform remains taboo.</p>

  <p>China remains a one-party state, with the Communist Party
    guaranteed a position of leadership in the country by the 1982
    Constitution. Like in the USSR, the party and state are deeply
    intertwined.</p>

  <p>Nominally, a few other parties are allowed to compete for a
    limited number of seats in the National People's Congress and
    other elected bodies, but—as was the case in East Germany and
    other Eastern European countries under communist rule during the
    Cold War era—these parties are essentially subservient to the CCP
    and follow the party line.</p>

  <p>Within the Communist Party, although there are factions, under
    the ideal of <em>democratic centralism</em> they generally do not
    make these divisions obvious in public.</p>

  <p>Like in the USSR, the formal titles of political figures do not
  always indicate the power held by Chinese leaders under the CCP

<p>The current leader of China is <strong lang="zh-Latn">Xi

  <p>China's national legislature, the <strong>National People's
  Congress</strong>, meets every year for around two weeks in Beijing. With
  nearly 3,000 members, it is the world's biggest
  legislature. Approximately 2/3 of the seats are reserved for the
  CCP, with the remainder of seats held by representatives of the
  “United Front” parties that are under the thumb of the
  CCP.</p>

  <p>The NPC's members are indirectly elected to five-year terms by
    the people's congresses of the various provinces, regions,
    directly-ruled cities, and special administrative regions. Members
    also represent the People's Liberation Army and, nominally, Taiwan

  <p>The regional and provincial congresses, in turn, are indirectly
    elected. Although at the very lowest level there are direct public
    elections, only a few independent candidates are allowed to
    compete. Registering new political parties, although technically
    legal, is subject to punishment by state authorities.</p>

  <p>In the relatively free special administrative regions of Hong
    Kong and Macau, which have partially-elected legislative bodies of

  <p>The two Special Administrative Regions (SARs), Hong Kong and

    democratic elections and works with local, pro-Beijing politicians
    at times to try to suppress dissent. The mainland government used
    the new “National Security Law” to impose a crackdown on the
    pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong starting in 2020.</p>

  <p>The PRC also claims sovereignty over Taiwan, but in practice
    Taiwan is governed by the remnants of the <em>Republic of
    China</em> government.</p>

  <p>The Nationalists (KMT) operated a PRI-like dominant-party
    dictatorship on Taiwan until the 1980s.</p>

  <p>Subsequent political reforms have made Taiwan a competitive
    multi-party democracy with a semi-presidential system of
    government modeled on France's system. The KMT now competes as a
    center-right party against the center-left Democratic Progressive
    Party.</p>
