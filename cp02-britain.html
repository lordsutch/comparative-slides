  <p>The Normans imposed their own legal and political system on
    England, based on <i>feudalism</i>; King William rewarded his
    Norman supporters with land and aristocratic titles.</p>

  <p>William's court, and his successors, continued to use French as
    their language, influencing the evolution of the English language.</p>

  <p>William conducted a detailed census of his lands, compiled in
    the <i>Domesday Book</i>, and used it to impose taxes on his new
    subjects.</p>

<img src="img/cp02-britain/Magna_Carta.jpg" style="float: right; width: 25%">

  <p>William's successors struggled to maintain control; each king
    wanted to rule with an iron fist, but he had to rely on his barons
    and dukes for taxes and men to fight the king's battles.</p>

  <p>In 1215, King John's nobles rebelled. To try to settle the
    dispute, John signed the <b>Magna Carta</b> or Great Charter,
    agreeing to respect the feudal rights of the nobility.</p>

  <p>The tradition of the Magna Carta made it difficult for future
    kings to attempt to impose <i>absolutism</i> on Britain.</p>

  <p>The king's need for taxes also required him to summon the
  nobility and Knights of the Shire to the king's court to gain their
    assent to new taxes.</p>

  <p>These gatherings of the nobility and knights became known
    as <b>Parliament</b>; the nobility came to comprise the <b>House
    of Lords</b> while the Knights of the Shire, representatives of
    the counties, formed the <b>House of Commons</b>.</p>

  <p>After Henry VIII broke with Rome, he used Parliament to help
    legally justify both his new Protestant church and his marital
    chicanery.</p>

    however, with the death of Elizabeth I, the closest heir to the

    working their way west.

  <p>In 1600s, James I promoted the settlement of the north of Ireland
    by English and Scottish settlers: the <i>Plantation of Ulster</i>.

  <p>Unlike Wales, Ireland had its own parliament until 1801, although
  it was much weaker than England's or Scotland's. Most real power was
    in the hands of the <i>Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</i>.

    War</i> (1642&ndash;48). Parliamentary forces led by Oliver
    Cromwell captured Charles; eventually Charles was tried and beheaded

    with the <i>Commonwealth</i>, a republic. Oliver Cromwell, however,
    soon disbanded Parliament and ruled as a military dictator under the
    title <i>Lord Protector</i>.</p>

  <p>When Cromwell died, his ineffective son Richard succeeded
    him. However, the army soon ousted Richard, eventually reinstated
    the pre-Commonwealth Parliament, and invited Charles' son to return
    from exile to take the throne, restoring the monarchy in 1660.</p>

  <p>Although most were happy to have the monarchy back, King
    Charles&nbsp;II's pro-Catholic sympathies were unpopular in most of
    Britain.</p>

  <p>When the openly Catholic James II succeeded to the throne in
    1685, and had a son who would be raised Catholic in 1688, the idea
    of a Catholic dynasty was intolerable to Parliament.

    <p>English nobles secretly invited the (Protestant) Dutch Prince
    William to invade the country, and, meeting little resistance in
    England, he and his wife Mary were soon crowned king and
    queen.</p>

  <p>The Glorious Revolution confirmed, once and for all, the
    supremacy of Parliament; Parliament would ultimately decide, from
    now on, who would be king or queen.</p>

  <p>William and Mary also agreed to the (English) <b>Bill of
      Rights</b>, which further limited the political power of the monarch
    and guaranteed Parliament and its members certain rights.</p>

  <p>When George I became king, he continued to concentrate on events
    in his native German state of Hanover. He left the affairs of
    Britain mostly to a <i>cabinet</i> of <i>ministers</i>, led by
    a <i>prime minister</i>, Sir Robert Walpole. The cabinet would
    exercise the powers of the Crown in the king's absence.

  <p>Although his grandson George III tried to rule a bit more
  forcefully in Britain&mdash;leading, in part, to the American
  Revolution&mdash;the failure of his policies and his poor health
  allowed Parliament to regain the upper hand.

  <h2>Unrepresentative Parliament</h2>

  <p>Although Parliament was now supreme, it was not particularly
    representative or democratic. Both the conservative <i>Tories</i>
    and the liberal <i>Whigs</i> were comprised of aristocrats and the
    well-to-do.

  <p>The House of Lords was still full of hereditary peers, while
    the Commons included dozens of representatives of
    so-called <i>rotten boroughs</i>. Few non-landowners could
    vote.</p>

</audio>

  <p>In the 1800s, the electorate was gradually expanded by a series
    of three <i>Reform Acts</i> that abolished rotten boroughs, gave
    more representation to the new cities that were growing due to
    industrialization, and allowed more men to vote.

  <p>However, no women could vote until 1918 (when, at the same
    time, all men 21 or older were granted the right to vote), and
    full adult universal suffrage did not come about until 1928.

  <p>Britain lacks a single, codified constitution. The basic
    principles of British government are a mix of traditions, laws, and
    customs.</p>

  <p>The main institutions are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Monarch</li>
    <li>The Cabinet and Prime Minister</li>
    <li>Parliament</li>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/Elizabeth_II_greets_NASA_GSFC_employees,_May_8,_2007_edit.jpg" style="width: 20%; float: right">
  <p>Although the queen (or king), by tradition and law, reigns over
    the United Kingdom, in practice he or she does not rule. Instead, by
    custom, the queen only acts on the advice of her ministers, usually
    the prime minister.</p>

  <p>As <i>head of state</i>, the monarch does have an important
  ceremonial role as the representative of Britain. Even symbolic
  acts, like Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Ireland in 2011, can have
  important political consequences.

  <h2>The Cabinet</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-21.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Real power is vested in the <i>cabinet</i> or <i>government</i>. Members
  of the cabinet are typically senior members of the majority party in
  the House of Commons; most today are members of the Commons,
  although usually some are members of the House of Lords.

  <p>Each member of the cabinet has a <b>portfolio</b> that they are
  politically responsible for. They may or may not have any particular
  expertise in that area of government, however; the day-to-day
  operation of the government agency they head is left up to a
  senior <i>civil servant</i> instead.</p>

  <p>The cabinet also is responsible for the <i>royal prerogative</i>,
    which are the powers of government that have not been assumed by
    Parliament. The prerogative includes many foreign policy matters,
    control of the armed forces, and the pardon power.</p>

  <p>The cabinet practices <I>collective responsibility</I>:
    disagreements are aired in private, but the cabinet presents a
    unified front in public.</p>

  <p>Typically the most prestigious position in the cabinet, other
      than the prime minister, is that of the <i>Chancellor of the
        Exchequer</i>. The Chancellor is responsible for producing the
      annual budget.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, Britain has <i>majority</i> governments with
    only one party, controlling a majority of the seats in the House
    of Commons, represented in the cabinet.</p>

  <p>However, from May 2010 until May 2015, Britain had
    a <i>coalition</i> government including multiple parties (the
    Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats) for the first time
    since World War II.</p>

  <p>The cabinet, collectively, is said to be <i>responsible</i> to
  Parliament. Ministers must account for their actions to the Commons
  and Lords, and are subject
  to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOw9cqdRSLA"
  ><i>Question Time</i></a> where members of each chamber demand
  answers to their questions about decisions they have made.</p>

  <p>If a majority of the Commons decides that the cabinet is no
    longer fit to rule, they can cast a <i>vote of no confidence</i>
    in the government; the government is then obliged to resign, and
    if no new cabinet can be formed quickly, new elections are
    held.</p>

<p>The current prime minister is Theresa May of the Conservative

  <p>Prime ministers appoint <i>whips</i> to keep rank-and-file

    they know how to vote on bills and amendments before
    Parliament.

  <p>Unlike in the U.S., <i>party discipline</i> is very strict in

  <p>The monarch's role today is mostly limited to presiding over
    the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xfhx5HH5_M"><i>State
        Opening of Parliament</i></a>, where she delivers a speech outlining
    the plans of the prime minister.

  <p>The monarch also, in theory, has the power to withhold <i>royal
      assent</i> from legislation (effectively, vetoing it), although no
    monarch has done so since Queen Anne in 1708.</p>

  <p>The Commons consists of 650 members, elected
    via <i>first-past-the-post</i> (plurality) elections from
    single-member constituencies across the United Kingdom. (After the
    election due in 2022, the size of the Commons will be reduced to
    600 seats.)</p>

  <p>If an MP dies or resigns, she or he is replaced at
    a <i>by-election</i>.</p>

  <p>By law and constitutional convention, the Commons must hold an
    election at least once every five years.</p>

  <p>A law passed in 2011 makes it harder for an &ldquo;early&rdquo;
    election to take place:
    <ul>
      <li>Either two-thirds of the total membership of the Commons
        must vote for an early election to take place, or</li>
      <li>The government must lose a vote of no confidence (unless a
        new government with the confidence of the Commons is formed
        within 14 days).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before this change, prime ministers would
    often strategically schedule early elections for their party's
    benefit.</p>

  <h2>The Role of the Commons</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-31.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

<p>The Commons chamber is arranged so the governing party or coalition
  sits to the Speaker's right and the <i>Opposition</i>, the largest
  party not in the Government, sits to the left; members of the other
  non-government parties usually also sit on the left, to symbolize
  their opposition to the government.</p>

  <p>The Opposition appoints a <i>shadow cabinet</i> of party
    spokespeople, who typically ask questions during Question Time.</p>

  <h2>Backbenchers and the Speaker</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-32.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Members of the Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet are
    called <i>frontbenchers</i>, since they sit on the front row near
    the speaker; rank-and-file MPs are called <i>backbenchers</i>.

  <p>The Speaker&mdash;unlike his or her American counterpart&mdash;is
    politically neutral; even at subsequent elections, the Speaker runs
    for reelection as an independent member.</p>

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-33.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Unlike in the U.S., <i>committees</i> in the Commons are
  relatively weak and a fairly new innovation. Because of party
  discipline, the prime minister usually gets his way on
  legislation.</p>

  <p>Instead, Commons committees typically scrutinize government
  agencies and the bureaucracy. They may also look into scandals and
    illegal conduct by the Government.

  <p>Frontbench MPs typically are not
  members of committees since they have other responsibilities (or it
  would be a conflict of interest).

  <h2>The House of Lords</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/House_of_Lords_chamber_-_toward_throne.jpg"
       style="width: 40%; float: right">

  <p>Today, the House of Lords consists of 800 peers, the vast
    majority of whom are <i>life peers</i>. The <i>hereditary
    peers</i>, over 800 aristocrats who inherited their title, choose
    90 <i>representative peers</i> to sit in the Lords on their

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-35.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Historically, the Lords was roughly equal in power with the
    Commons. For the past century, however, the Lords has only had the
    power to delay&mdash;not completely block&mdash;legislation proposed
    by the Commons.</p>

  <p>However, the Lords play an important role in scrutinizing
  legislation proposed by the Government; in some ways, they work more
  like committees in the U.S. Congress than Commons committees do.</p>

  <h2>Reforming the Lords?</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-36.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Reform of the House of Lords to make it a more democratic
    institution has been debated, off-and-on, for years. Although all
    of the parties agree it <i>should</i> be reformed, a lack of
    agreement on <i>how</i> the Lords should be reformed has led to a
    lack of action.

  <p>Many fear an elected upper house would either overshadow the
    Commons or become a dumping ground for mediocre
    politicians&mdash;much like the European Parliament is perceived.

  <p>Abolition is also an option; the <i>devolved assemblies</i> are
    all <i>unicameral</i>, as are some national parliaments today.

  <h2>The Legal System</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-37.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>The legal systems in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are
      based on <i>common law</i> like in the United States. The laws
      of England and Wales are mostly identical.</p>

  <p>Scottish law is based on a combination of <i>common law</i> and
    continental-style <i>civil law</i>. Other ways Scottish law differs:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Not proven</i>: third possible verdict in criminal cases.
      <li>Jury verdicts in criminal cases are by a simple majority,
        rather than a supermajority.
    </ul>
    
  <p>Judges are appointed by the government based on recommendations
    by an independent judicial appointments commission. Unlike in the
    U.S., judges are not chosen by politicians or elected by voters.</p>

  <p>Since 2009, the <b>Supreme Court of the United Kingdom</b> has
  been the highest court in Britain for all civil matters, along with
    criminal matters in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Court also has the power to decide whether or not an
    action by the devolved governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland,
    and Wales is within their legal powers.</p>

  <p>Unlike the highest courts in most other democracies, the Supreme
    Court cannot declare a law passed by Parliament to be
    unconstitutional, although it can find an action by the government
    unlawful if it exceeds the powers delegated to it by law.</p>

  <p>In the past two decades, Britain has <i>devolved</i> power over

  <p>Each devolved assembly selects its own government, headed by
    a <i>first minister</i>, responsible for day-to-day governing and
    setting the policy agenda.

  <p>The powers of each assembly are
    a bit different; Scotland generally has the most independent power

  <p>In Northern Ireland, rules require <i>power sharing</i> between
    the Protestant and Catholic communities. All cabinets are
    coalitions including both Unionist and Nationalist parties.</p>

  <p>When a cabinet cannot be formed that meets with approval of both
    communities, Northern Ireland reverts to <i>direct rule</i> by the
    UK government, as was the case from 1972 to 1999.</p>

  <p>Designed to avoid a recurrence of the Protestant domination that

    <ul>
      <li>The Conservative Party (or <i>Tories</i>).</li>
      <li>The Labour Party.</li>
      <li>The Liberal Democratic Party (formed when the old <i>Liberal
        Party</i> merged with a short-lived party of moderate
        ex-Labour Party members in the 1980s).</li>
      <li>The UK Independence Party (UKIP), generally socially conservative

    independent Scotland within the European Union.

  <p>In 2014, the SNP government in Scotland held a referendum on
    Scottish independence, which saw approximately 55% of Scottish
    voters vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on independence.</p>

  <p>The <i>first-past-the-post</i> or <i>plurality</i> voting system

  <p>More parties are represented in the devolved assemblies; they
    (along with the European Parliament) use <i>proportional
      representation</i> (PR) systems where elections are designed to ensure
    that the percentage of seats a party earns is roughly proportional
    with their share of the vote.

  <p>PR helps ensure minor parties get their fair share of seats, but
    it also usually means that one party doesn't have enough seats to
    rule on its own; instead, in PR systems, <i>coalition</i>
    governments are routine.</p>
