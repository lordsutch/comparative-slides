  <p>Meanwhile, William gathered an army and invaded across the
    English Channel, defeating and killing Harold at the <em>Battle of
    Hastings</em>.</p>

  <p>William quickly consolidated his position and was crowned King in

  <p>The Normans imposed their own legal and political system on
    England, based on <em>feudalism</em>; King William rewarded his
    Norman supporters with land and aristocratic titles.</p>

  <p>William's court, and his successors, continued to use French as
    their language, influencing the evolution of the English language.</p>

  <p>William conducted a detailed census of his lands, compiled in
    the <em>Domesday Book</em>, and used it to impose taxes on his new
    subjects.</p>

<img src="img/cp02-britain/Magna_Carta.jpg" style="float: right; width: 25%">

  <p>William's successors struggled to maintain control; each king
    wanted to rule with an iron fist, but he had to rely on his barons
    and dukes for taxes and men to fight the king's battles.</p>

  <p>In 1215, King John's nobles rebelled. To try to settle the
    dispute, John signed the <strong>Magna Carta</strong> or Great Charter,
    agreeing to respect the feudal rights of the nobility.</p>

  <p>The tradition of the Magna Carta made it difficult for future
    kings to attempt to impose <em>absolutism</em> on Britain.</p>

  <p>The king's need for taxes also required him to summon the
  nobility and Knights of the Shire to the king's court to gain their
    assent to new taxes.</p>

  <p>These gatherings of the nobility and knights became known
    as <strong>Parliament</strong>; the nobility came to comprise the <strong>House
    of Lords</strong> while the Knights of the Shire, representatives of
    the counties, formed the <strong>House of Commons</strong>.</p>

  <p>After Henry VIII broke with Rome, he used Parliament to help
    legally justify both his new Protestant church and his marital
    chicanery.</p>

    however, with the death of Elizabeth I, the closest heir to the

    working their way west.

  </p>
<p>In 1600s, James I promoted the settlement of the north of Ireland
    by English and Scottish settlers: the <em>Plantation of Ulster</em>.

  </p>
<p>Unlike Wales, Ireland had its own parliament until 1801, although
  it was much weaker than England's or Scotland's. Most real power was
    in the hands of the <em>Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</em>.

  <p>Both James and his son, Charles I, tried to rule England like
    the Stuart kings had ruled Scotland, in a more absolutist fashion.</p>

  <p>Charles' efforts to bully Parliament into raising taxes to
    support his wars backfired, leading to the <em>English Civil
    War</em> (1642–48). Parliamentary forces led by Oliver
    Cromwell captured Charles; eventually Charles was tried and beheaded

  <p><img src="img/cp02-britain/Standard_of_Oliver_Cromwell_(1653%E2%80%931659).svg" style="float: right; width: 15%">Parliament replaced the monarchy
    with the <em>Commonwealth</em>, a republic. Oliver Cromwell, however,
    soon disbanded Parliament and ruled as a military dictator under the
    title <em>Lord Protector</em>.</p>

  <p>When Cromwell died, his ineffective son Richard succeeded
    him. However, the army soon ousted Richard, eventually reinstated
    the pre-Commonwealth Parliament, and invited Charles' son to return
    from exile to take the throne, restoring the monarchy in 1660.</p>

  <p>Although most were happy to have the monarchy back, King
  Charles&nbsp;II's pro-Catholic sympathies were unpopular in much of
  Britain, particularly among the nobility.</p>

  <p>When the openly Catholic James II succeeded to the throne in
  1685, and had a son who would be raised Catholic in 1688, the idea
  of a Catholic dynasty became intolerable to Parliament.</p>

  <p>Several years earlier, James' eldest daughter Mary had married a
  Protestant noble, William, Prince of Orange
  and <em lang="nl">stadtholder</em> of much of the Netherlands;
  William was also the son of Charles I's eldest daughter.

  <p>English nobles secretly invited William to invade the
  country, and, meeting little resistance in England, William and
  Mary were soon crowned as co-ruling king and queen.</p>

  <p>The Glorious Revolution confirmed, once and for all, the
  supremacy of Parliament; Parliament would ultimately decide, from
  now on, who would be king or queen.</p>

  <p>William and Mary also agreed to the (English) <strong>Bill of
  Rights</strong>, which further limited the political power of the
  monarch and guaranteed Parliament and its members certain
  rights.</p>

  <p>During the reign of Queen Anne, the day to day affairs of state
  were increasingly left to her advisors to manage, a trend that
  continued when she was succeeded by King George&nbsp;I, who had been
  the ruler of the German state of Hanover.

  <p>George left the affairs of Britain mostly to a <em>cabinet</em>
  of <em>ministers</em> who served in parliament, led by a <em>prime
  minister</em>, Sir Robert Walpole.</p>

  <p>Although his great grandson George III tried to rule a bit more
  forcefully in Britain—leading, in part, to the American
  Revolution—the failure of his policies and his poor health allowed
  Parliament to regain the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Although Parliament was now supreme, it was not particularly
  representative or democratic. Both the conservative <em>Tories</em>
  and the liberal <em>Whigs</em> were comprised of aristocrats and the
  well-to-do.</p>

  <p>The House of Lords was still full of hereditary peers, while the
  Commons included dozens of representatives of so-called <em>rotten
  boroughs</em>. Few non-landowners could vote.</p>

</audio>

  <p>Starting in 1832, the electorate was gradually expanded by a
  series of three <em>Reform Acts</em> that abolished the rotten
  boroughs, gave more representation to the new cities and towns that
  were growing due to industrialization, and allowed more men to
  vote.</p>

  <p>However, no women could vote until 1918 (when, at the same time,
  all men 21 or older were granted the right to vote), and full adult
  universal suffrage did not come about until 1928.</p>

</audio>

  <p>Britain lacks a single, codified constitution. The basic
    principles of British government are a mix of traditions, laws, and
    customs.</p>

  <p>The main institutions are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Monarch</li>
    <li>The Cabinet and Prime Minister</li>
    <li>Parliament</li>
  </ul>

<img src="img/cp02-britain/527px-Prince_Charles_in_Aotearoa_(cropped).jpg"
     style="width: 20%; float: right">
  <p>Although the king (or queen), by tradition and law, reigns over
    the United Kingdom, in practice he or she does not rule. Instead,
    by custom, the king only acts on the advice of his ministers,
    usually the prime minister.</p>

  <p>As <em>head of state</em>, the monarch does have an important
  ceremonial role as the representative of Britain. Even symbolic
  acts, like Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Ireland in 2011, can have
  important political consequences.

</p></section>

  <h2>The Cabinet</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-21.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Real power is vested in the <em>cabinet</em>
  or <em>government</em>. Members of the cabinet are typically senior
  members of the majority party in the House of Commons; most today
  are members of the Commons, although usually some are members of the
  House of Lords.</p>

  <p>Each member of the cabinet has a <strong>portfolio</strong> that
  they are politically responsible for. They may or may not have any
  particular expertise in that area of government, however; the
  day-to-day operation of the government agency they head is left up
  to a senior <em>civil servant</em> instead.</p>

  <p>The cabinet also is responsible for the <em>royal
  prerogative</em>, which are the powers of government that have not
  been assumed by Parliament. The prerogative includes many foreign
  policy matters, control of the armed forces, and the pardon
  power.</p>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/s300_1_budget2014_news_story.jpg" style="width: 20%; float: right">


  <p>The cabinet practices <em>collective responsibility</em>:
    disagreements are aired in private, but the cabinet presents a
    unified front in public.</p>

  <p>Typically the most prestigious position in the cabinet, other
      than the prime minister, is that of the <em>Chancellor of the
        Exchequer</em>. The Chancellor is responsible for producing the
      annual budget.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, Britain has <em>majority</em> governments with
    only one party, controlling a majority of the seats in the House
    of Commons, represented in the cabinet.</p>

  <p>However, from May 2010 until May 2015, Britain had
    a <em>coalition</em> government including multiple parties (the
    Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats) for the first time
    since World War II.</p>

  <p>The cabinet, collectively, is said to be <em>responsible</em> to
  Parliament. Ministers must account for their actions to the Commons
  and Lords, and are subject to regular questioning such
  as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40441042C458B62B"
  ><em>Prime Minister's Questions</em></a>, where members of each
  chamber demand answers to their questions about decisions they and
  the government have made.</p>

  <p>If a majority of the Commons decides that the cabinet is no
  longer fit to rule, they can cast a <em>vote of no confidence</em>
  in the government; the government is then obliged to resign, and if
  no new cabinet can be formed quickly, new elections would be
  held.</p>

  <p>The current prime minister is Keir Starmer of
  the <span lang="en-GB">Labour Party</span>, who has been in office
  since July 2024.</p>

  <p>Prime ministers appoint <em>whips</em> to keep rank-and-file

  they know how to vote on bills and amendments before Parliament.</p>

  <p>The monarch's public role today is mostly limited to presiding
  over the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbDtU9EcZDE"><em>State
  Opening of Parliament</em></a>, where he or she delivers a speech
  outlining the plans of the prime minister.</p>

  <p>The monarch also, in theory, has the power to withhold <em>royal
  assent</em> from legislation—effectively, vetoing it—although no
  monarch has done so since Queen Anne in 1708.</p>

  <p>The Commons consists of 650 members, elected
  via <em>first-past-the-post</em> (plurality) elections from
  single-member constituencies across the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>If an MP dies or resigns, she or he is replaced at
  a <em>by-election</em>.</p>

  <p>By law and constitutional convention, the Commons must hold an
  election at least once every five years. Prime ministers can—and
  often do—request a dissolution of Parliament before the five years
  is up, which will lead to an early election.</p>

  <p>A law passed in 2011 makes it harder for an “early”
    election to take place:
    </p>
<ul>
      <li>Either two-thirds of the total membership of the Commons
        must vote for an early election to take place, or</li>
      <li>The government must lose a vote of no confidence (unless a
        new government with the confidence of the Commons is formed
        within 14 days).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Intended to stop PMs from strategically scheduling early
    elections for their party's benefit, but hasn't worked and is
    expected to be repealed.</p>

  <h2>The Role of the Commons</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-31.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>The Commons chamber is arranged so the governing party or
  coalition sits to the Speaker's right and the <em>Opposition</em>,
  the largest party not in the Government, sits to the left; members
  of the other non-government parties usually also sit on the left, to
  symbolize their opposition to the government.</p>

  <p>The Opposition appoints a <em>shadow cabinet</em> of party
  spokespeople, who typically ask questions during Question Time.</p>

  <h2>Backbenchers and the Speaker</h2>

</audio>

  <p>Members of the Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet are
  called <em>frontbenchers</em>, since they sit on the front row near
  the speaker; rank-and-file MPs are called <em>backbenchers</em>.</p>

  <p>The Speaker—unlike his or her American counterpart—is politically
  neutral; even at subsequent elections, the Speaker runs for
  reelection as an independent member.</p>

  <h2>Committees in the Commons</h2>

</audio>

  <p>Unlike in the U.S., <em>committees</em> in the Commons are
  relatively weak and a fairly new innovation. Because of party
  discipline, the prime minister usually gets his way on
  legislation.</p>

  <p>Instead, Commons committees typically scrutinize government
  agencies and the bureaucracy. They may also look into scandals and
  illegal conduct by the Government.</p>

  <p>Frontbench MPs typically are not members of committees since they
   have other responsibilities (or it would be a conflict of interest).</p>

  <h2>The House of Lords</h2>

</audio>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/House_of_Lords_chamber_-_toward_throne.jpg" style="width: 40%; float: right">

  <p>Today, the House of Lords consists of around 800 peers, the vast
  majority of whom are <em>life peers</em>, who are nominally
  appointed by the monarch but in practice are named by the prime
  minister. The <em>hereditary peers</em>, over 800 aristocrats who
  inherited their title, choose 90 <em>representative peers</em> to
  sit in the Lords on their behalf.</p>

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-35.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Historically, the Lords was roughly equal in power with the
  Commons. For the past century, however, the Lords has only had the
  power to delay—not completely block—legislation proposed by the
  Commons.</p>

  <p>However, the Lords play an important role in scrutinizing
  legislation proposed by the Government; in some ways, they work more
  like committees in the U.S. Congress than Commons committees do.</p>

  <h2>Reforming the Lords?</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">

</audio>

  <p>Reform of the House of Lords to make it a more democratic
  institution has been debated, off-and-on, for years. Although all of
  the parties agree it <em>should</em> be reformed, a lack of
  agreement on <em>how</em> the Lords should be reformed has led to a
  lack of action.</p>

  <p>Many fear an elected upper house would either overshadow the
  Commons or become a dumping ground for mediocre politicians—much
  like the European Parliament was perceived to be.</p>

  <p>Abolition is also an option; the <em>devolved assemblies</em> are
  all <em>unicameral</em>, as are some national parliaments today.</p>

  <p>For now, the current Labour government has committed to removing
  the voting rights of the remaining hereditary peers, which would
  leave just the life peers remaining. Members would also be required
  to retire at the age of 80.</p>

  <h2>The Legal System</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-britain/cp-britain-37.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>The legal systems in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are
   based on <em>common law</em> like in the United States. The laws
   of England and Wales are mostly identical.</p>

  <p>Scottish law is based on a combination of <em>common law</em> and
  continental-style <em>civil law</em>. Other ways Scottish law differs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Not proven</em>: third possible verdict in criminal cases.</li>
    <li>Jury verdicts in criminal cases are by a simple majority,
      rather than a supermajority.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>British judges are appointed by the government based on
  recommendations by an independent judicial appointments
  commission. Unlike in the U.S., judges are not chosen by politicians
  or elected by voters.</p>

  <p>Since 2009, the <strong>Supreme Court of the United
  Kingdom</strong> has been the highest court in Britain for all civil
  matters, along with criminal matters in England, Wales, and Northern
  Ireland.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Court also has the power to decide whether or not an
  action by the devolved governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland,
  and Wales is within their legal powers.</p>

  <p>Unlike the highest courts in most other democracies, the Supreme
  Court cannot declare a law passed by Parliament to be
  <em>unconstitutional</em>, although it can find an action by the
  government unlawful if it exceeds the powers delegated to it by
  law.</p>

  <p>In the past two decades, Britain has <em>devolved</em> power over
  many domestic matters from the government in London to elected
  assemblies in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>Powers devolved include education, health care, transportation,
    economic development, and language policy.</p>

  <p>Each devolved assembly selects its own government, headed by
  a <em>first minister</em>, responsible for day-to-day governing and
  setting the policy agenda.</p>

  <p>The powers of each assembly are a bit different; the Scottish
  Parliament generally has the most independent power while the

  <p>In Northern Ireland, rules require <em>power sharing</em> between
  the Protestant and Catholic communities. All cabinets are
  coalitions including both Unionist and Nationalist parties.</p>

  <p>When a cabinet cannot be formed that meets with approval of both
  communities, Northern Ireland reverts to <em>direct rule</em> by the
  UK government, as was the case from 1972 to 1999.</p>

  <p>Debate over whether all UK MPs should vote on laws that only

  rough order of popularity:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Labour Party.</li>
    <li>The Conservative Party (or <em>Tories</em>).</li>
    <li>The Liberal Democratic Party (formed when the old <em>Liberal

      ex-Labour Party members in the 1980s).</li>

  <p>In addition to the main U.K. parties, the most important party in

    U.K.-wide parties that are <em>unionist</em>, the SNP favors an
    independent Scotland within the European Union.</p>

  <p>In 2014, the SNP government in Scotland held a referendum on
    Scottish independence, which saw approximately 55% of Scottish

  <p>UK-wide parties don't typically seek office in Northern
  Ireland. The most important parties in Northern Ireland are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Two <em>unionist</em> (or <em>loyalist</em>) parties favor
      Northern Ireland remaining part of the U.K.: the Ulster Unionist
      Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).</li>
    <li>Two <em>nationalist</em> parties favor reunification of Ireland
      and Northern Ireland as a single country: the Social Democratic
      and Labour Party (SDLP) and <em lang="ga">Sinn Féin</em>.</li>
    <li>The small Alliance Party opposes <em>sectarianism</em> and
      supports peaceful coexistence between the Catholic and Protestant
      communities.</li>

  <p>In recent years the two biggest parties in Northern Ireland have

  <p>Despite the large number of parties, the Commons is typically
    dominated by the Conservatives and Labour.</p>

  <p>The <em>first-past-the-post</em> or <em>plurality</em> voting
    system with <em>single member districts</em> means that the
    largest party usually gets a majority of seats at Westminster,
    often with well under 50% of the
    vote. This <em>disproportionality</em> was particularly pronounced
    in the 2024 election, where the Labour Party won 33.7% of the vote
    but gained 63.2% of the seats (411 of 650) in the Commons.</p>

  <p>More parties are represented in the devolved lawmaking bodies
  (the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, along with the Northern Ireland
  Assembly and London Assembly); they use different forms
  of <em>proportional representation</em> (PR) where elections are
  designed to ensure that the percentage of seats a party earns is
  roughly proportional with their share of the vote.</p>

  <p>PR helps ensure minor parties get their fair share of seats, but
  it also usually means that one party doesn't have enough seats to
  rule on its own; instead, in PR systems, <em>coalition</em>
  governments are routine.</p>
