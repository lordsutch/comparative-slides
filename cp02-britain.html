  <h2>Geography</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/United_Kingdom_countries.svg"
       style="float: right; width: 30%">
  
  <p>Today Britain (officially, the <em>United Kingdom of Great
      Britain and Northern Ireland</em>) comprises
      four <em>countries</em> within the British Isles:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>On the island of <em>Great Britain</em>:</p></li>
    <ul>
    <li>England (53 million people)</li>
    <li>Scotland (5.3 million)</li>
    <li>Wales (3.1 million)</li>

  <li>~9500 BCE: Human settlement resumes after last glacial period.
  <li>~600 BCE: Celtic settlement of Britain.
  <li>43&ndash;410 CE: Roman Britain.
    <ul>
      <li>Some cultural influence but little settlement.
      <li>Celtic culture remained in Scotland, Ireland, and Welsh highlands.

  <ul>
    <li>865&ndash;954: Vikings rule much of England (the <i>Danelaw</i>).
    <li>790&ndash;1030: Viking invasions and rule of Normandy
      (part of northern France).

<section>
  <h2>The Norman Conquest</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/Norman-conquest-1066.svg"
       style="float: right; width: 45%; background: #fff">

  <p>Harold attempted to deal with the rival claimants to the throne in
    Britain, defeating most of them.</p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile, William gathered an army and invaded across the
    English Channel, defeating and killing Harold at the <i>Battle of
    Hastings</i>.</p>

  <p>William quickly consolidated his position and was crowned King in
    London on Christmas Day, 1066.</p>
   
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Norman Rule in England</h2>

  <p>The Normans imposed their own legal and political system on
    England, based on <i>feudalism</i>; King William rewarded his
    Norman supporters with land and aristocratic titles.</p>

  <p>William's court, and his successors, continued to use French as
    their language, influencing the evolution of the English language.</p>

  <p>William conducted a detailed census of his lands, compiled in
    the <i>Domesday Book</i>, and used it to impose taxes on his new
    subjects.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Magna Carta</h2>

<img src="img/cp02-britain/Magna_Carta.jpg" style="float: right; width: 25%">
  
  <p>William's successors struggled to maintain control; each king
    wanted to rule with an iron fist, but he had to rely on his barons
    and dukes for taxes and men to fight the king's battles.</p>

  <p>In 1215, King John's nobles rebelled. To try to settle the
    dispute, John signed the <b>Magna Carta</b> or Great Charter,
    agreeing to respect the feudal rights of the nobility.</p>

  <p>The tradition of the Magna Carta made it difficult for future
    kings to attempt to impose <i>absolutism</i> on Britain.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Parliament and King</h2>

  <p>The king's need for taxes also required him to summon the
  nobility and Knights of the Shire to the king's court to gain their
    assent to new taxes.</p>

  <p>These gatherings of the nobility and knights became known
    as <b>Parliament</b>; the nobility came to comprise the <b>House
    of Lords</b> while the Knights of the Shire, representatives of
    the counties, formed the <b>House of Commons</b>.</p>

    <p>After Henry VIII broke with Rome, he used Parliament to help
    legally justify both his new Protestant church and his marital
      chicanery.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Great Britain under One King</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/Flag_of_Wales_2.svg" style="float: right; width: 15%">
  <p>In the 14th century, Edward I had conquered Wales; over the next
    two centuries, English law was extended to cover Wales as well.</p>

  <p><img src="img/cp02-britain/Flag_of_Scotland.svg" style="float:
    right; width: 15%"> Scotland proved impervious to invasion;
    however, with the death of Elizabeth I, the closest heir to the
    English throne was James VI of Scotland, who became James I of
    England as well in 1603. Scotland kept its own Parliament
    until 1707.</p>
    
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Ireland under English Rule</h2>

  <p><img src="img/cp02-britain/Royal_Standard_of_Ireland_(1542–1801).svg"
    style="float: right; width: 15%">English kings had also begun to
    gradually gain control of Ireland, starting from Dublin and
    working their way west.

  <p>In 1600s, James I promoted the settlement of the north of Ireland
    by English and Scottish settlers: the <i>Plantation of Ulster</i>.

  <p>Unlike Wales, Ireland had its own parliament until 1801, although
  it was much weaker than England's or Scotland's. Most real power was
    in the hands of the <i>Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</i>.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Charles I and Civil War</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/King_Charles_I_after_original_by_van_Dyck.jpg"
style="float: right; width: 20%">       
  <p>Both James and his son, Charles I, tried to rule England like
    the Stuart kings had ruled Scotland, in a more absolutist fashion.</p>

  <p>Charles' efforts to bully Parliament into raising taxes to
    support his wars backfired, leading to the <i>English Civil
    War</i> (1642&ndash;48). Parliamentary forces led by Oliver
    Cromwell captured Charles; eventually Charles was tried and beheaded
    for treason.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Commonwealth and the Restoration</h2>

  <p><img src="img/cp02-britain/Standard_of_Oliver_Cromwell_(1653–1659).svg"
  style="float: right; width: 15%">Parliament replaced the monarchy
  with the <i>Commonwealth</i>, a republic. Oliver Cromwell, however,
  soon disbanded Parliament and ruled as a military dictator under the
  title <i>Lord Protector</i>.
  
<p>When Cromwell died, his ineffective son Richard succeeded
  him. However, the army soon ousted Richard, eventually reinstated
  the pre-Commonwealth Parliament, and invited Charles' son to return
  from exile to take the throne, restoring the monarchy.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Glorious Revolution</h2>

  <p>Although most were happy to have the monarchy back, King
  Charles&nbsp;II's pro-Catholic sympathies were unpopular in most of
  Britain.</p>

  <p>When the openly Catholic James II succeeded to the throne in
    1685, and had a son who would be raised Catholic in 1688, the idea
    of a Catholic dynasty was intolerable to Parliament.

    <p>English nobles secretly invited the (Protestant) Dutch Prince
    William to invade the country, and, meeting little resistance in
    England, he and his wife Mary were soon crowned king and
    queen.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Bill of Rights and the Succession</h2>
  
  <p>The Glorious Revolution confirmed, once and for all, the
    supremacy of Parliament; Parliament would ultimately decide, from
    now on, who would be king or queen.</p>

  <p>William and Mary also agreed to the (English) <b>Bill of
      Rights</b>, which further limited the political power of the monarch
    and guaranteed Parliament and its members certain rights.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Cabinet Government</h2>

<img src="img/cp02-britain/Retuched_Painting_of_Robert_Walpole.jpg" style="float: right; width: 20%">
  
  <p>When George I became king, he continued to concentrate on events
    in his native German state of Hanover. He left the affairs of
    Britain mostly to a <i>cabinet</i> of <i>ministers</i>, led by
    a <i>prime minister</i>, Sir Robert Walpole. The cabinet would
    exercise the powers of the Crown in the king's absence.

  <p>Although his grandson George III tried to rule a bit more
  forcefully in Britain&mdash;leading, in part, to the American
  Revolution&mdash;the failure of his policies and his poor health
  allowed Parliament to regain the upper hand.
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Unrepresentative Parliament</h2>

  <p>Although Parliament was now supreme, it was not particularly
    representative or democratic. Both the conservative <i>Tories</i>
    and the liberal <i>Whigs</i> were comprised of aristocrats and the
    well-to-do.

  <p>The House of Lords was still full of hereditary peers, while
    the Commons included dozens of representatives of
    so-called <i>rotten boroughs</i>. Few non-landowners could
    vote.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Reform Acts</h2>
  
  <p>In the 1800s, the electorate was gradually expanded by a series
    of three <i>Reform Acts</i> that abolished rotten boroughs, gave
    more representation to the new cities that were growing due to
    industrialization, and allowed more men to vote.

  <p>However, no women could vote until 1918 (when, at the same
    time, all men 21 or older were granted the right to vote), and
    full adult universal suffrage did not come about until 1928.
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Rise of Labour</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Tories evolved into the Conservative Party.
    <li>Whigs evolved into the Liberal Party.
    <li>Neither represented interests of working-class citizens.

    <li><b lang="en-GB">Labour Party</b> established in 1900, with
    support of labor unions. Demands:
      <ul>
        <li>Establishment of a <i>welfare state</i>.
        <li><i>Nationalization</i> of major sectors of the economy.
      </ul>
    <li>Liberal Party support declined as Labour gained votes.
      
    <li>Labour's victory in the 1945 election allowed it to pursue
      this agenda.
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Post-War Britain</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Post-war economic boom allowed Labour to nationalize
      industries and build the welfare state.
    <li><p>Conservatives came to accept much of this as inevitable.
    <li><p>Economic crises of 1970s and recovery of Japan and Germany
      hurt competitiveness of British industry.

    <li><p>Since the 1980s both major parties have pursued reforms to
      reduce cost of the welfare state and privatize industry, with
      mixed success.</li>
  </ul>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The British Constitution</h2>

  <p>Britain lacks a single, codified constitution. The basic
    principles of British government are a mix of traditions, laws, and
    customs.</p>

  <p>The main institutions are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Monarch</li>
    <li>The Cabinet and Prime Minister</li>
    <li>Parliament</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Monarch</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/Elizabeth_II_greets_NASA_GSFC_employees,_May_8,_2007_edit.jpg" style="width: 20%; float: right">
  <p>Although the queen (or king), by tradition and law, reigns over
    the United Kingdom, in practice he or she does not rule. Instead, by
    custom, the queen only acts on the advice of her ministers, usually
    the prime minister.</p>

  <p>As <i>head of state</i>, the monarch does have an important
  ceremonial role as the representative of Britain. Even symbolic
  acts, like Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Ireland in 2011, can have
  important political consequences.
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Cabinet</h2>

  <p>Real power is vested in the <i>cabinet</i> or <i>government</i>. Members
  of the cabinet are typically senior members of the majority party in
  the House of Commons; most today are members of the Commons,
  although usually some are members of the House of Lords.

  <p>Each member of the cabinet has a <b>portfolio</b> that they are
  politically responsible for. They may or may not have any particular
  expertise in that area of government, however; the day-to-day
  operation of the government agency they head is left up to a
  senior <i>civil servant</i> instead.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>More on The Cabinet</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/s300_1_budget2014_news_story.jpg"
  style="width: 20%; float: right">


  <p>The cabinet practices <I>collective responsibility</I>:
    disagreements are aired in private, but the cabinet presents a
    unified front in public.</p>

  <p>Typically the most prestigious position in the cabinet, other
      than the prime minister, is that of the <i>Chancellor of the
        Exchequer</i>. The Chancellor is responsible for producing the
      annual budget.</p>

</section>
<section>
  <h2>Majority and Coalition Cabinets</h2>
  
  <p>Most of the time, Britain has <i>majority</i> governments with
    only one party, controlling a majority of the seats in the House
    of Commons, represented in the cabinet.</p>
      
  <p>However, from May 2010 until May 2015, Britain had
    a <i>coalition</i> government including multiple parties (the
    Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats) for the first time
    since World War II.</p>
    
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Cabinet Responsibility</h2>

  <p>The cabinet, collectively, is said to be <i>responsible</i> to
  Parliament. Ministers must account for their actions to the Commons
  and Lords, and are subject
  to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOw9cqdRSLA"
  ><i>Question Time</i></a> where members of each chamber demand
  answers to their questions about decisions they have made.</p>

  <p>If a majority of the Commons decides that the cabinet is no
    longer fit to rule, they can cast a <i>vote of no confidence</i>
    in the government; the government is then obliged to resign, and
    if no new cabinet can be formed quickly, new elections are
    held.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Prime Minister</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/336px-Theresa_May_UK_Home_Office.jpg"
  style="width: 25%; float: right">

  <p>The <i>prime minister</i> is the leader of the government. Today,
  he or she typically chooses the cabinet, and is ultimately
  responsible for the performance of the government.

<p>The current prime minister is Theresa May of the Conservative
  Party, who has been in office since July 2016.</p>
    
  <p>In theory, the prime minister need not be a member of the Commons,
    but in practice he or she has always been an MP for the past century.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Whips and Party Discipline</h2>
    
  <p>Prime ministers appoint <i>whips</i> to keep rank-and-file
    members of their party (<i>backbenchers</i>) in line and ensure
    they know how to vote on bills and amendments before
    Parliament.

  <p>Unlike in the U.S., <i>party discipline</i> is very strict in
    Britain; voting against the party whip even once can lead to an MP
    being thrown out of the party.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Parliament</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/Palace_of_Westminster,_London_-_Feb_2007.jpg"
       style="width: 40%; float: right">
  <p>Legally, Parliament (the law-making part of the government)
  consists of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Monarch</li>
    <li>The House of Commons</li>
    <li>The House of Lords</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Queen-in-Parliament</h2>
  
  <p>The monarch's role today is mostly limited to presiding over
    the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xfhx5HH5_M"><i>State
        Opening of Parliament</i></a>, where she delivers a speech outlining
    the plans of the prime minister.
    
  <p>The monarch also, in theory, has the power to withhold <i>royal
      assent</i> from legislation (effectively, vetoing it), although no
    monarch has done so since Queen Anne in 1708.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Electing the House of Commons</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/House_of_Commons.jpg"
       style="width: 30%; float: right">

  <p>The Commons consists of 650 members, elected
    via <i>first-past-the-post</i> (plurality) elections from
    single-member constituencies across the United Kingdom. (After the
    next election, the size of the Commons will be reduced to 600
    seats.)</p>

  <p>If an MP dies or resigns, she or he is replaced at
    a <i>by-election</i>.</p>

  <p>By law and constitutional convention, the Commons must hold an
    election at least once every five years.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Fixed-Term Parliaments</h2>
    
  <p>A law passed in 2011 makes it harder for an &ldquo;early&rdquo;
    election to take place:
    <ul>
      <li>Either two-thirds of the total membership of the Commons
        must vote for an early election to take place, or</li>
      <li>The government must lose a vote of no confidence (unless a
        new government with the confidence of the Commons is formed
        within 14 days).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before this change, prime ministers would
    often strategically schedule early elections for their party's
    benefit.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Role of the Commons</h2>

<p>The Commons chamber is arranged so the governing party or coalition
  sits to the Speaker's right and the <i>Opposition</i>, the largest
  party not in the Government, sits to the left; members of the other
  non-government parties usually also sit on the left, to symbolize
  their opposition to the government.</p>

  <p>The Opposition appoints a <i>shadow cabinet</i> of party
    spokespeople, who typically ask questions during Question Time.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Backbenchers and the Speaker</h2>
  
  <p>Members of the Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet are
    called <i>frontbenchers</i>, since they sit on the front row near
    the speaker; rank-and-file MPs are called <i>backbenchers</i>.
    
  <p>The Speaker&mdash;unlike his or her American counterpart&mdash;is
    politically neutral; even at subsequent elections, the Speaker runs
    for reelection as an independent member.</p>
</section>

<section>

  <h2>Committees in the Commons</h2>
  
  <p>Unlike in the U.S., <i>committees</i> in the Commons are
  relatively weak and a fairly new innovation. Because of party
  discipline, the prime minister usually gets his way on
  legislation.</p>

  <p>Instead, Commons committees typically scrutinize government
  agencies and the bureaucracy. They may also look into scandals and
    illegal conduct by the Government.

  <p>Frontbench MPs typically are not
  members of committees since they have other responsibilities (or it
  would be a conflict of interest).
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The House of Lords</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/House_of_Lords_chamber_-_toward_throne.jpg"
       style="width: 40%; float: right">

  <p>Today, the House of Lords consists of 789 peers, the vast
    majority of whom are <i>life peers</i>. The <i>hereditary
    peers</i>, over 800 aristocrats who inherited their title, choose
    92 representative peers to sit in the Lords on their behalf.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What do the Lords do?</h2>
  
  <p>Historically, the Lords was roughly equal in power with the
    Commons. For the past century, however, the Lords has only had the
    power to delay&mdash;not completely block&mdash;legislation proposed
    by the Commons.</p>

  <p>However, the Lords play an important role in scrutinizing
  legislation proposed by the Government; in some ways, they work more
  like committees in the U.S. Congress than Commons committees do.</p>

</section>

<section>

  <h2>Reforming the Lords?</h2>

  <p>Reform of the House of Lords to make it a more democratic
    institution has been debated, off-and-on, for years. Although all
    of the parties agree it <i>should</i> be reformed, a lack of
    agreement on <i>how</i> the Lords should be reformed has led to a
    lack of action.

  <p>Many fear an elected upper house would either overshadow the
    Commons or become a dumping ground for mediocre
    politicians&mdash;much like the European Parliament is perceived.
    
  <p>Abolition is also an option; the <i>devolved assemblies</i> are
    all <i>unicameral</i>, as are some national parliaments today.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Devolution and Quasi-Federalism</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/Flag-map_of_the_United_Kingdom_(subdivisions).svg"
       style="width: 30%; float: right; background: #fff">

  <p>In the past two decades, Britain has <i>devolved</i> power over
    many domestic matters from the government in London to elected
    assemblies in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>Powers devolved include education, health care, transportation,
    economic development, and language policy.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Powers of Devolved Governments</h2>
  
  <p>Each devolved assembly selects its own government, headed by
    a <i>first minister</i>, responsible for day-to-day governing and
    setting the policy agenda.

  <p>The powers of each assembly are
    a bit different; Scotland generally has the most independent power
    (and its assembly is called a Parliament, unlike the other two),
    while the Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies have a bit less.
  </p>
</section>

<section>

  <h2>Devolution in Northern Ireland</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/StormontChamber.JPG"
       style="width: 40%; float: right; background: #fff">
  <p>In Northern Ireland, rules require <i>power sharing</i> between
    the Protestant and Catholic communities. All cabinets are
    coalitions including both Unionist and Nationalist parties.

    <p>Designed to avoid a recurrence of the Protestant domination
    that took place when Northern Ireland was under &ldquo;home
    rule&rdquo; from 1921 to 1972 and the
    subsequent <i>Troubles</i>.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Devolution in England?</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/Flag_of_England.svg"
       style="width: 30%; float: right">

  <p>Although there was a proposal to set up <i>regional
      assemblies</i> across England about a decade ago, the only one that
    was established was for Greater London.</p>

  <p>Debate over whether all UK MPs should vote on laws that only affect
    England&mdash;called the &ldquo;West Lothian
    Question&rdquo;&mdash;has led to discussion of whether there should
    be a separate <i>English</i> Parliament as well.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The European Parliament</h2>

  <img src="img/cp02-britain/640px-European_Parliament,_Plenar_hall.jpg"
       style="width: 40%; float: right">
<p>Like the other members of the European Union, Britain also elects
  representatives to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.

<p>The European Parliament was originally little more than a
  discussion forum, but today has important powers to scrutinize the
  EU's &ldquo;executive branch&rdquo; (the European Commission) and
  laws proposed by the representatives of Europe's governments, the

  <h2>Political Parties</h2>

  <p>In most of the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland), the
    most important political parties that contest elections are, in
    rough order of popularity:

    <ul>
      <li>The Conservative Party (or <i>Tories</i>).</li>
      <li>The Labour Party.</li>
      <li>The Liberal Democratic Party (formed when the old <i>Liberal
        Party</i> merged with a short-lived party of moderate
        ex-Labour Party members in the 1980s).</li>
      <li>The UK Independence Party (UKIP), generally socially conservative
        and opposed to European integration.</li>
      <li>The Green Party.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Scottish National Party</h2>

  <p>In addition to the main U.K. parties, the most important party in
    Scotland is the <i>Scottish National Party</i>. Unlike the
    U.K.-wide parties that are <i>unionist</i>, the SNP favors an
    independent Scotland within the European Union.

  <p>In 2014, the SNP government in Scotland held a referendum on
    Scottish independence, which saw approximately 55% of Scottish
    voters vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on independence.</p>

  <p>The SNP competes for seats in the UK Parliament, Scottish
  Parliament, and EU Parliament, as well as local governments in
  Scotland.

<section>
  <h2 lang="cy">Plaid Cymru</h2>
  
  <p>In Wales, the pro-independence <i lang="cy">Plaid
  Cymru</i> (Welsh for &ldquo;Party of Wales&rdquo;) favors Welsh
  independence within the European Union.</p>

  <p><span lang="cy">Plaid Cymru</span> competes for seats in the UK
  Parliament, Welsh Assembly, and EU Parliament, as well as local
  governments in Wales.

<section>
  <h2>Parties in Northern Ireland</h2>

  <p>UK-wide parties don't typically seek office in Northern Ireland.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Two <i>unionist</i> (or <i>loyalist</i>) parties favor
      Northern Ireland remaining part of the U.K.: the Ulster Unionist
      Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).</li>
    <li>Two <i>nationalist</i> parties favor reunification of Ireland
      and Northern Ireland as a single country: the Social Democratic
      and Labour Party (SDLP) and <i lang="ga">Sinn Fein</i>.</li>
    <li>The small Alliance Party opposes <i>sectarianism</i> and
      supports peaceful coexistence between the Catholic and Protestant
      communities.</li>
  </ul>
    
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Elections and the Party System</h2>

  <p>Despite the large number of parties, the Commons is typically
    dominated by the Conservatives and Labour.</p>
    
  <p>The <i>first-past-the-post</i> or <i>plurality</i> voting system
    with <i>single member districts</i> means that the largest party
    usually gets a majority of seats at Westminster, even if it only
    gets 40&ndash;45% of the vote.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Elections and the Party System</h2>
  
  <p>More parties are represented in the devolved assemblies; they
    (along with the European Parliament) use <i>proportional
      representation</i> (PR) systems where elections are designed to ensure
    that the percentage of seats a party earns is roughly proportional
    with their share of the vote.

  <p>PR helps ensure minor parties get their fair share of seats, but
    it also usually means that one party doesn't have enough seats to
    rule on its own; instead, in PR systems, <i>coalition</i>
    governments are routine.</p>

       style="float: right; width: 27.5%"
       alt="Map showing support for exiting the European Union in June 2016 referedum.">

  <ul>
    <li><p>52% of voters supported withdrawing from the European Union in
      June 2016 referendum.
    <li><p>Result not legally binding but current government
        has pledged to withdraw.</p>
    <li>Exit negotiations may be complex:
        <ul>
          <li>Politicians, voters want continued access to
            Common Market.
          <li>EU may want substantial concessions on free movement
            of labor, monetary contributions to EU members.
    </ul></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Divisions in British Society</h2>

  <ul>

    <li><p><i>Social class</i>: importance of class has declined, but
      still prominent in politics today.

    <li><p><i>Region</i>: urban/rural divisions and division between
      England and the rest of the U.K., particularly Scotland.

    <li><p><i>Public services</i>: maintaining the NHS is an
    increasing financial drain on governments, but fees and
    privatization are unpopular.

    <li><p><i>Immigration</i>: migrants from Eastern Europe and the
      developing world are changing Britain's demographics, particularly
      in the big cities of England.
