  <p><b>Nigeria</b> (officially, the <i>Federal Republic of
  Nigeria</i>) is the most populous country in Africa and the 7th most
  populous country in the world. It is located in West Africa.

  <h2>Before the Europeans</h2>

</audio>

  <p>Nigeria home of several civilizations before Europeans arrive in
    the 15th century:
    <ul>
      <li>Southwest dominated by the <i>Yoruba</i>, who had a
        centralized empire.
      <li>Southeast home to the <i>Igbo</i>, network of
        largely-independent villages.
      <li>North: <i>Hausa</i> and <i>Fulani</i> peoples; converted to
        Islam in 9th century A.D.
    </ul>

  <p>Today, the division between the largely Muslim north and the
  Christian south remains, and reinforces the ethnic distinction
  between the various Nigerian peoples.

  <h2>Early European Influence</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-03.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>The first European nation to exert influence was
    Portugal in 1471; other European nations would follow.</p>

  <p>European exploration was limited by both disease and the hostile
    climate, so rather than exploiting inland resources they
    capitalized on what was immediately at hand: people.</p>

  <p>The practice of slavery in Africa was nothing new, but the
    Europeans brought it to a much larger scale.  Millions of people
    from southern Nigeria and elsewhere along the African coast were
    enslaved; most were shipped from Africa to the Americas to work on
    plantations of cotton, sugarcane, and tobacco across the Atlantic.

  <p>A war in the early 19th century in the north led to the
    establishment of the <b>Sokoto Caliphate</b>, a strictly Islamic
    state.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the south Christian missionaries began to spread
  inland and were later followed by European soldiers and governments
  to help protect them.

  <h2>British Involvement</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-05.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Nigeria began to come under British influence in the mid-1800s as
  a result of the British Navy's crackdown on slavery and the slave
  trade. They replaced the trade in people with trade in commodities,
  particularly oils.

  <p>However, although the slave trade was ended, slavery within the
    area continued. To put a stop to slavery altogether, Britain
    fought battles against the Yoruba in the southwest and eventually
    took over the Yoruba capital, <i>Lagos</i>, in 1861.

  <h2>British Influence Expands</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-06.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>In the following years, British traders began to work their way
  inland along the Niger River and its tributaries, spreading British
  influence further in West Africa.

  <p>As part of the &ldquo;Scramble for Africa,&rdquo; Britain and
   other European powers spread their claims and influence as wide as
   they could, leaving a patchwork of borders that often had little to
   do with Africa's ethnic or religious divisions. The land that would
   become Nigeria was no different.

  <h2>Inventing Nigeria</h2>

  <img src="img/cp11-nigeria/LordLugard.jpg"
       style="width: 25%; float: right; background:transparent"
       alt="Frederick Lugard.">

  <p>Modern Nigeria was formed from two distinct territories under
  British rule: a southern protectorate in the Yoruba and Igbo lands,
  and the largely Muslim north.

  <p>The two territories were merged in 1914 under the leadership of
  Frederick Lugard, an experienced colonial administrator.

  <p>However, the main reason why the merger took place was not
  political&mdash;instead, it essentially was done for economic
  reasons: the north was running a budget deficit, and the south had a
  budget surplus.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Divide and Rule</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-08.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus">
<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-08.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Most British colonies in Africa and Asia were not <i>settler
      colonies</i> like Australia or Canada, and Britain never
      intended to make its colonies part of Britain proper.

  <p>Instead, in these colonies a small ruling class of colonial
    administrators presided over millions of natives. They
    used <i>divide and rule</i> techniques, playing groups of local
    populations against each other so they would not work together to
    overthrow the British.

  <p>The British also ruled <i>indirectly</i>, using local rulers
    and elites rather than imposing a European ruling elite.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Limited Self-Rule</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-09.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus">
<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-09.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Divide-and-rule made it easier for former British colonies to
  govern themselves when they reached independence, but also deepened
  the internal divisions in those societies.

  <p>The British also tended to allow more self-rule in their colonies
  than most of the other European powers. Colonies typically had an
  unelected council of local elites that the governor would consult;
  elections would be eventually introduced to provide for limited
  direct representation.

  <p>In Nigeria, this pattern was followed, although southerners were
  better represented than northerners in its Legislative Council.

  <h2>Decolonization</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">

<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-10.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>The Second World War weakened colonialism throughout the
  world. Colonial powers no longer had the wealth to sustain their
  sprawling empires, and the rhetorical commitment of the Western
  Allies in their fight against the Axis to freedom and
  anti-totalitarianism clashed with the reality of colonial rule.

  <p>The peak period of decolonization in Africa was during the
  1960s. It was easier in colonies like Nigeria that had few European
  settlers than it was in colonies that had large numbers of settlers
  like Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).

  <p>Decolonization in Nigeria was a gradual process. The first
  Nigerian political party, Nigerian National Democratic Party, was
  founded in 1923 by Herbert Macaulay.

<p>During World War II, Macaulay and other Nigerians formed the
  National Council of Nigeria and Cameroons (NCNC), a &ldquo;big
  tent&rdquo; nationalist party. Other pro-independence parties were
  founded in this era as well, some based on regional or ethnic
  interests, including the Action Party.

<p>In 1947, Britain established a federal structure for Nigeria, with
  three regions corresponding to the major ethnic groups: Northern,
  Western, and Eastern.

<p>A national House of Representatives was established in 1951, and
  the federation and the regions were allowed self-government in most
  areas in 1954.

<p>Western Nigeria was under the control of the Action Party, the NCNC
  dominated the Eastern region, and the North was controlled by the
  Northern People's Congress.

<p>Nigeria formally became independent on October 1, 1960. It briefly
  had a federal parliamentary system modeled on Britain's, and
  retained Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.

<p>In 1963 it abolished the monarchy and became a federal
  parliamentary republic.

<p>In 1966, a pair of military coups ousted the civilian government
  amid regional tensions and widespread corruption.</p>

<p>From 1967 to 1970, partially due to the coups, a rebellion in the

  <p>Nigeria was under military rule 1966&ndash;79 and 1983&ndash;99.

  <p>In theory, military rule should bring stability, but even under
    military rule there are factions <i>within</i> the military that
    plot against each other.

  <p>Although they often took office to stamp out corruption, military
    rulers were not immune from becoming corrupt themselves. Several
    were also implicated in serious human rights abuses.</p>

  <p>Two former military rulers, Olusegun Obasanjo and Muhammadu
    Buhari, have been elected as presidents during the current
    democratic period.

    serve as president for two terms.

  <p>The current president is former military ruler <b>Muhammadu
  Buhari</b> of the All Progressives Congress, who won the election in
  March 2015 with around 54% of the national vote; took office on May
  29th, 2015.

  <p>The Nigerian legislature is known as the <b>National Assembly</b>.

  <p>The Nigerian <b>House of Representatives</b> has 360 members, which are
  apportioned to the states and the Federal Capital
  Territory (Abuja) on the basis of population.

  <p>Like in the U.S. and Britain, representatives are chosen by the
    simple plurality (first-past-the-post) election system from
    single-member districts in each state. Representatives serve
    four-year terms.

  <p>Nigeria's <b>Senate</b> includes 109 senators: 3 from each of the

  <p>Although Nigeria was originally divided into three regions at
    independence, over the years it has been subdivided even
    further. Since 1996, Nigeria has included 36 states.

  <p>In addition, the Federal Capital Territory was established in
    1976 as the home of the planned capital city of Abuja, which
    officially became the capital in 1991, replacing Lagos in the
    southwest.

  <h2>Nigerian Federalism</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-20.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Like in other countries, federalism allows the people in the various
    states to govern themselves somewhat differently from others.</p>

  <p>In Nigeria this is particularly pronounced because of the use
    of <i>sharia</i> or Muslim law in northern states, which mean
    those states have very different laws than those in the
    Christian-dominated southern states.</p>

  <p>However, since the national government controls the revenues from
    oil, states depend heavily on federal funding; they don't always
    have as much independence as they might appear to on paper.</p>

</audio>

  <p>Political parties in Nigeria are still somewhat immature.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The former ruling party, the <b>People's Democratic
          Party</b> (PDP), held power since the return of democracy in
          1999 until 2015. Of the two groupings, they tend to be more
          economically conservative.</p></li>

      <li><p>The <b>All Progressives Congress</b> (APC) is a
          newly-created party formed to contest the 2015 election. Its
          members tend to be more economically liberal.</p></li>
    </ul>

  <p>Both parties tend to be very socially conservative by European or
    American standards, reflecting the strong Christian and Islamic
    influences in Nigerian society.

  <h2>Divisions in Nigerian Society</h2>

<source data-src="audio/cp-nigeria/cp-nigeria-22.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>The major divisions are <i>religious</i>, <i>geographic</i>,
    and <i>ethnic</i>, and these categories tend to go together; most
    ethnic groups are heavily associated with either Islam or
    Christianity, and concentrated in particular regions.

  <p>Today Muslims outnumber Christians in Nigeria as a whole,
    although Christians tend to be better off and historically have
    held more power in Nigerian politics.

  <p>A major problem is that most of Nigeria's divisions tend to
    reinforce each other, rather than being &ldquo;cross-cutting
    cleavages&rdquo; that mean that people tend to have things in common
    with other people outside their group.</p>

</audio>

  <p>The 2015 elections and the mostly peaceful handover of power from
    the PDP to the APC is a major milestone for Nigeria, much like the
    PRI giving up power to the PAN in Mexico in 2000.

  <p>It remains to be seen whether the military will avoid the
    impulse to intervene at the first sign of trouble, and whether the
    APC can govern effectively as a single party after only just
    unifying in the past two years.

  <p>Nonetheless Nigerians seem to want democracy to work and will
    likely get a lot of outside support to help them succeed, unlike
    during the immediate post-colonial period.</p>
