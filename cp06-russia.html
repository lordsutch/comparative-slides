  <h2>Geography</h2>
  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Rs-map.png" style="width: 50%"
       alt="Map of Modern Russia">

  <p>Russia, officially known as the <b>Russian Federation</b>
    (<em lang="ru">Российская Федерация</em>
    or <em lang="ru-Latn">Rossiyskaya Federatsiya</em>), spans across
    the northern part of Asia and the easternmost portion of
    Europe. It is the largest country by area in the world, spanning
    11 time zones.</p>

<p>However, most of Russia is thinly populated; most Russians live in
  the western and southwestern portions of the country.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Language and Culture</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Soviet_passport.jpg"
       style="width: 25%; float: right"
       alt="Soviet passport, showing Latin and Cyrillic text.">

  <p>Like many other eastern European languages, Russian is written in
    an alphabet based on Greek known as <i>Cyrillic</i>, after Saint
    Cyril, who was responsible for converting many of the Slavs to
    Christianity.

    <p>Some letters are more-or-less the same as in the Latin alphabet
    used in English, while some are different; some Cyrillic letters
    have the same shapes as Latin letters but different meanings.

    <p>Russia and much of eastern Europe historically was under the
      influence of the <i>Orthodox Church</i>, which broke with the
      Roman Catholic Church in 1054 AD.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Early History</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/725px-001_Kievan_Rus_Kyivan_Rus_Ukraine_map_1220_1240.jpg"
       style="width: 35%; float: right"
       alt="Map of the Kievan Rus' ca. 1220">

  <p>Various Slavic tribes united in the 7th&ndash;9th centuries in
  the western portion of modern Russia and areas of modern Belarus and
  Ukraine into a federation known as the <i>Rus'</i> or <i>Kievan
  Rus'</i>.

  <p>Its capital was first in modern Russia at Novogorod, but was
    moved to the more defensible location of Kiev (in modern Ukraine) in
    the 9th century.</p>

  <p>The Rus' was relatively stable for a few centuries, but fell
    apart in the 13th century in the face of invasions by the Mongols
    and internal division within the state.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Emergence of Moscow</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/474px-1000_Ivan_III.jpg"
       style="width: 25%; float: right"
       alt="Ivan III of Russia">

  <p>Under Mongol rule, various small states vied for influence as
    tributary states of the Mongols (or Tatars). One of these states was
    the principality of Moscow, also known as <i>Muscovy</i>.

  <p>The rulers of Moscow were able to gain power as trusted agents
    of the Tatars; when the Tatars became weaker, Muscovy drove them
    off of Russian lands, further increasing Moscow's stature.

  <p>The most powerful early ruler was <b>Ivan III</b>, who tripled
  the size of Muscovy, imposed absolute rule on his subjects, and
  built up the reputation of the nascent Russian state.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Tsardom and the Romanovs</h2>

  <p><b>Ivan IV</b>, better known as <i>Ivan the Terrible</i>, was the
    first Russian ruler to style himself as <i>tsar</i> (from
    &ldquo;ceasar,&rdquo; or emperor). He lived up to his nickname by
    ruthlessly dominating the Russian nobility, although he was also
    known as an effective statesman and reformer at times as well.</p>

  <p>In the decades after Ivan's death, Russia was plunged into chaos and was
    even ruled, for a time, by the neighboring <i>Polish-Lithuanian
    Commonwealth</i>. Eventually the foreign rulers were driven out,
    and Russian self-rule restored.

  <p>The new line of tsars came from the Romanov family, who would
  rule Russia continuously for the next 300 years, until the collapse
  of the monarchy in 1917.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Absolutism and Expansion</h2>

  <p>Even more than the French, the Romanovs practiced absolutist
  rule. At a time when other European countries were already
  abandoning serfdom, Russia widened its use. And while the first
  Romanov tsar, Michael I, was actually elected by a national
    assembly, the new line of emperors became increasingly autocratic.

  <p>During the late 1600s and early 1700s, under <b>Peter the
  Great</b>, Russia expanded across Siberia and conquered neighboring
  European territories to become the world's
    largest country.

  <p>Peter also sought to &ldquo;Europeanize&rdquo; Russia, building
  an extravagant new capital, Saint Petersburg (later known during
  communist times as Petrograd and Leningrad), on the Baltic Sea. He also
  &ldquo;modernized&rdquo; Russia by drawing on the inspiration of the
  French absolutist kings like <span lang="fr">Louis XIV</span>.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>19th Century Reform: Too Little, Too Late</h2>

  <p>Napoleon's armies&mdash;although ultimately defeated, thanks
  largely to the harsh Russian winter&mdash;made Russians aware just
  how far behind western Europe their country was. Russians were
  divided between those who wanted to emulate the West more closely
  and those who wanted to stand up for a unique, Slavic culture.

    <p>Meanwhile, the tsars rarely paid much heed to the need for
    political and economic reform. Although the serfs were nominally
    freed under Alexander II in 1861, peasant life was still brutal
    and other political reforms were lacking.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Anarchists and Communists</h2>

<p>The lack of meaningful political reform led to radical movements
  emerging in Russia. Some intellectuals rejected the ideas of the
  state and traditional government entirely. Others favored
  a <b>Marxist</b> revolution to bring about a socialist
  state, but disagreed as to how they might make it come about.</p>

  <p>The secret police within Russia were very effective in rooting
  out revolutionary groups across the spectrum, so many of these
  groups' leaders were forced into exile. One of these groups, the
  Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, would become critical in the
  decades to come.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mensheviks and Bolsheviks</h2>

  <p><i>Gradualists</i> tended to favor improvements
  in working conditions for peasants and factory workers, along with
  industrialization, in the hopes that absolutism would give way to
  capitalism, which in turn would fall to socialism, per the
    predictions of Karl Marx.

  <p><i>Militants</i> favored revolution and a direct transition from
  Russian absolutism to socialism. Their leaders, like Vladimir Lenin,
  believed that Marx's economic ideas could be fused with a political
  approach called <i>democratic centralism</i>: a free debate followed
  by ironclad party discipline once a course of action has been
  decided.

  <p>Lenin's group within the Russian socialist movement became known as
  the <i lang="ru-Latn">Bolshevik</i> faction.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Russo-Japanese War</h2>

<p>The expanding Russian empire in the east came into conflict with
  Japanese expansion into modern Korea and northern China
  (Manchuria). The Russians thought they could easily defeat Japan,
  but instead suffered a humiliating defeat.</p>

<p>Russians rose up in protest against the tsar, Nicholas II, who was
  forced to offer reforms, including elections to a national
  parliament, the <b lang="ru-Latn">Duma</b>.

<p>While this was a baby step toward mass democracy, Nicholas kept
  real power under his control by making ministers accountable to him,
  not the elected <span lang="ru-Latn">Duma</span>. Few Russians were
  satisfied.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The February Revolution</h2>

<img src="img/cp06-russia/322px-Alexander_Kerensky_LOC_24416.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 25%"
     alt="Alexander Kerensky">

<p>In World War I, Russia was one of the allies that were arrayed against the
  Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary). However, the war went
  very badly for Russia, whose armies again were proven inferior to
  those of their rivals.

<p>In March 1917 (late February under the old Russian calendar),
  moderate politicians forced Nicholas II from power and established
  the <b>Provisional Government</b> under Alexander Kerensky, a social
  democrat. Kerensky, however, vowed to continue the war, an unpopular
  stance among the Russian people.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The October Revolution</h2>

  <p>The Germans hoped to get Russia out of the war by provoking
    continued unrest there; they gave Lenin and several other
    communists free passage through their territory to go to Russia
    and foment revolution.

  <p>The Provisional Government had control of the army, but the
    Bolsheviks organized the <i lang="ru-Latn">soviets</i>&mdash;councils of
    workers, peasants, and soldiers&mdash;to undermine state power.

  <p>In late October on the old Russian calendar (early November),
    Lenin and the St. Petersburg <i lang="ru-Latn">soviet</i> rose up
    and ousted the Provisional Government. They quickly sued for peace
    with Germany in the <i>Treaty of Brest-Litvosk</i> on terms very
    favorable to the Germans.

</section>


<section>
  <h2>The Civil War and War Communism</h2>

<img src="img/cp06-russia/324px-Lenin_CL.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 17.5%"
     alt="Vladimir Lenin">

  <p>Russian opponents of the Bolsheviks, and World War I allies who
  felt betrayed by Russia's withdrawal from the conflict with Germany,
  waged a civil war to stop the Bolsheviks from gaining control of the
  Russian Empire.  The anti-communist &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; were
  eventually defeated by the &ldquo;Reds,&rdquo; but at a heavy cost.

  <p>At the same time the civil war raged, Lenin tried to
  implement a socialist economic system by nationalizing the entire
  economy. Ironically, only American charity saved the Russian people
  under <b>war communism</b> from mass starvation as the forced
  collectivization of agriculture failed miserably.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The New Economic Policy</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg"
     style="float: right; width: 20%; border: none"
     alt="Flag of the Soviet Union">

  <p>At the conclusion of the civil war, the former Russian Empire was
    reconstituted as the <b>Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</b>
    (USSR; Cyrillic: <em lang="ru">СССР</em>).  Although
    theoretically the USSR was a federation of states, in practice
    Russia and ethnic Russians called the shots.</p>

  <p>The period of war communism demonstrated that Russia wasn't ready
    yet for full-blown socialism. Lenin implemented the <i>New
    Economic Policy</i>, which limited state control to heavy industry
    and returned most farming, light industry, and commerce to private
    ownership. Not surprisingly, the Soviet economy began to recover.

  <p>Lenin died in 1924, leaving no clear successor. Over the next two
    years, various leaders jockeyed for power.

</section>

<section>
<h2>Joseph Stalin</h2>

<img src="img/cp06-russia/CroppedStalin1943.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 20%"
     alt="Joseph Stalin">

<p>When Joseph Stalin came to power in 1926, he began a series
  of <i>purges</i> designed to eliminate the other early Bolshevik
  leaders along with other rivals. Estimates suggest over a million
  people were killed; millions more were imprisoned, exiled, or
  removed from government posts.

  <p>Stalin also initiated a program of <i>dekulakization</i> to bring
  agriculture under state control by killing hundreds of thousands of
  peasant farmers and their families. These policies caused a massive
  famine, leading to between 5 and 8 million deaths.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Stalin in World War II</h2>

  <p>Stalin and Hitler, despite being ideological opponents, secretly
  cooperated early in the war to divide Poland. On Stalin's orders,
  thousands of Poles were massacred by the Soviets, including both
  civilians and prisoners of war.

<p>When Hitler turned on Stalin and invaded, the Soviet military was
  taken by complete surprise; it was also ill-equipped and weak due to
  Stalin's purges. The assault went well initially for the Germans,
  but the failure to capture Moscow and Leningrad quickly led to the
  Soviets being able to regroup in 1942 and turn the tide.

  <p>In total, 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war; over
  two-thirds were civilians.

</section>


<section>
  <h2>Stalin After World War II</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/EasternBloc_BasicMembersOnly.svg"
     style="float: right; width: 20%"
     alt="The Eastern Bloc">

  <p>After the war, Stalin brought most of the countries of central
  and eastern Europe that had been liberated from Germany under
  communist one-party rule; most stayed aligned to the USSR as part of
    the <b>Warsaw Pact</b> until 1989.

  <p>He also supported the spread of communism in Asia, bolstering the
  Chinese Communist Party and helping establish the North Korean
    regime.

  <p>Within the Soviet Union, he fostered a cult of personality. He
    also emphasized Russian nationalism&mdash;despite being a
    Georgian, not a Russian, himself.

  <p>Stalin died in 1953 under mysterious circumstances; he was likely
    assassinated by the head of the
    KGB, <span lang="ru-Latn">Lavrentiy Beria</span>.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Nikita Khrushchev</h2>

<img src="img/cp06-russia/358px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-B0628-0015-035,_Nikita_S._Chruschtschow.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 17.5%"
     alt="Nikita Khrushchev">

  <p>Stalin's successors dismantled his cult of personality and faced
  more accountability from their fellow party leaders.

  <p>After a brief period of in-fighting (which culminated in an
    internal party <i>coup</i>), new leader Nikita Khrushchev put in
    place a policy of <i>de-Stalinization</i>.</p>

  <p>Although he did reduce repression within the Soviet Union, he
  maintained the Soviets' iron grip on eastern Europe and presided
  over an era of great tension with the United States, most notably
  during the <i>Cuban Missile Crisis</i> in 1962.

<p>Khrushchev himself was deposed in 1964, ostensibly on the basis of
  &ldquo;advanced age and ill health.&rdquo;
</p>

</section>


<section>
  <h2>Leonid Brezhnev</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Leonid_Brezhnev.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 20%"
     alt="Leonid Brezhnev">

<p>After Khrushchev was deposed, Leonid Brezhnev was made general
  secretary of the CPSU. Under his watch, the Soviets lost the
  &ldquo;space race,&rdquo; tensions emerged with China, and economic
  issues and corruption became increasingly problematic.

<p>In 1979, he launched an invasion of Afghanistan to support the
  communist government in Kabul; the Russians were quickly bogged down
  in conflict with <i lang="ar-Latn">mujahideen</i> guerrillas
  supported by the United States.

<p>Brezhnev died in office in 1982, although real power had passed to
  several others in 1981 due to his ill health.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Last Soviet Rulers</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/323px-RIAN_archive_485307_Mikhail_Gorbachev.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 20%"
     alt="Mikhail Gorbachev">

<p>Brezhnev was succeeded by two short-lived rulers, Yuri Andropov
  (1982&ndash;84) and Konstantin Chernenko (1984&ndash;85). Andropov
  realized the depth of the problems facing the Soviet Union and began
  a program of reform and continued arms limitation talks with the
  West, but became seriously ill just months into his
  leadership. Chernenko was already terminally ill when he became
  general secretary.

<p>The last Soviet leader was Mikhail Gorbachev
  (1985&ndash;91). Initially expected to continue Andropov's program
  of gradual reform, he eventually was forced by economic
  circumstances to introduce much more drastic change.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Institutions Under Communism</h2>

  <p>In theory, the institutions of the Soviet state and those of the
  Communist Party were separate. In practice, they were deeply
  intertwined, and control of the Party meant control of the state.

  <p>The <b lang="ru-Latn">gensek</b> or general secretary of the
  Communist Party was usually the effective ruler, although after
  Stalin he could not rule completely unchecked; the other members of
  the <b lang="ru-Latn">Politburo</b> could step in and overrule the
  general secretary's decisions.

  <p>Theoretically, the power of the state was in the hands of a
    legislature known as the <b>Supreme Soviet</b>; in practice, its
    powers were exercised by <span lang="ru-Latn">Politburo</span>
    members who were appointed as a matter of course to the Presidium
    and key ministerial positions.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Soviet Bureaucracy</h2>

  <p>The socialist economic system required a massive bureaucracy to
  maintain and control it. The bureaucracy was kept under the control
  of the Communist Party through the system
    of <b lang="ru-Latn">nomenklatura</b>; only those favored by the
  party could be appointed to the most important and prestigious jobs.

  <p>The operation of the Soviet economy was orchestrated
  by <b lang="ru-Latn">Gosplan</b>, the State Planning Committee; it
  was responsible for implementing the Five-Year Plans developed by
  the Party. To work, central planning relied on near-perfect
    knowledge of what would be needed and when it would be required.

  <p>The planners often lacked knowledge of either, leading at times
    to comical results&mdash;usually massive overproduction or
    underproduction of needed goods.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Chekists: The <span lang="ru-Latn">KGB</span></h2>

  <p>To maintain its control, the Soviet Union had an extensive state
  security police bureau that went by various names over the
  years. After Stalin died, it was known as the Committee on State
  Security, or the <b lang="ru-Latn">KGB</b>.

  <p>Like the former East German <span lang="de">Stasi</span>,
  the <span lang="ru-Latn">KGB</span> extensively monitored the
  private lives of Soviet citizens. Political dissidents could be sent
  to the gulag, forced to move to &ldquo;closed cities&rdquo;
  under <span lang="ru-Latn">KGB</span> control, institutionalized in
  mental hospitals, fired from their jobs, or harassed
  by <span lang="ru-Latn">KGB</span> operatives.

  <p>Modern Russia has a body known as
  the <span lang="ru-Latn">FSB</span> that is effectively the
  successor of the old <span lang="ru-Latn">KGB</span>.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Glasnost and Perestroika</h2>

  <p>By the 1980s, it was clear that the Eastern Bloc was unable to
    keep up with the West. The USSR was beset by widespread corruption
    and inefficiency, compounded by worsening public services and
    alcoholism.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev concluded that the Soviet state needed fundamental
    restructuring (<i lang="ru-Latn">perestroika</i>) and greater
    openness to criticism (<i lang="ru-Latn">glasnost</i>). Private
    sector businesses were allowed again, and greater criticism of
    government and party policies was tolerated.</p>

  <p>However, even at the end, Gorbachev wanted to preserve
    Marxism-Leninism and the USSR, at least in some form.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Unintended Consequences</h2>

  <p>The biggest unintended consequence
    of <i lang="ru-Latn">glasnost</i> was the return of nationalism,
    not just in the USSR's republics but also in the Eastern
    Bloc. People under communist rule also became more aware of the
    better lifestyle most Westerners enjoyed and the full extent of
    Stalin's crimes.

  <p>Following Gorbachev's decision to allow the Warsaw Pact countries
    to democratize without Soviet intervention, nationalists in the
    Baltic and Caucasus republics agitated for independence from the
    Russian-dominated USSR.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The August Coup</h2>

  <p>When the CPSU's monopoly on power was removed by Gorbachev,
    nationalist parties won elections in several Soviet republics and
    moved toward independence. Meanwhile, reformist former Politburo
    member Boris Yeltsin became the leader of the Russian Supreme
    Soviet, increasing tension between the Russian and USSR
    governments.

  <p>The final death knell was
  the <a href="http://ezproxy.mga.edu/login?url=http://digital.films.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?aid=27469&xtid=8966">attempted <i>coup</i></a>
  against Gorbachev in August 1991. Although the coup failed and
  Gorbachev was reinstated as president, real power was now in the
  hands of Yeltsin, who had led to opposition to the coup in
  Moscow. The CPSU was dissolved and banned, and most of the republics
  declared independence.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Denouement</h2>

  <p>In December, the four republics that had not declared
    independence did so, effectively abolishing the USSR, and formed
    the <i>Commonwealth of Independent States</i> in its place.

  <p>With no republics left, Gorbachev bowed to the inevitable. With
    his resignation as president, the USSR was officially dissolved on
    December 25, 1991.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Crisis of 1993</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/White_House-3.jpg"
       style="float: right; width: 30%"
       alt="The Russian White House, after the fighting.">

  <p>Yeltsin at first was very popular, due to his role in the breakup
    of the USSR and the fall of Communism. However, his economic
    &ldquo;shock therapy&rdquo; policies were deeply unpopular, and
    led to tensions with the <i>Congress of People's Deputies</i>, the
    Russian parliament at the time.

  <p>In September 1993, the tensions came to a head, as Yeltsin tried
    to dissolve the parliament while the CPD attempted to impeach
    Yelstin for violating the Constitution (by dissolving
    parliament). After days of street fighting between the two sides'
    supporters, interior ministry forces loyal to Yeltsin stormed the
    Russian White House building.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A New Constitution</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Yeltsin.jpg"
       style="float: right; width: 20%"
       alt="Boris Yeltsin">

  <p>In the aftermath, a new Constitution was adopted, modeled on that
    of France, strengthening presidential power at the expense of the
    new <i>Federal Assembly</i>.

  <p>However, Yeltsin also got along poorly with the new legislature,
    and he was unable to continue many of his reforms.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Vladimir Putin Takes Power</h2>

  <p>Toward the end of his presidency, Yelstin appointed former KGB
  operative Vladimir Putin as his prime minister and handed increasing
    power over to him as his health continued to deteriorate.</p>

  <p>When Yeltsin resigned from office on December 31, 1999, Putin
    took over as <i>acting president</i> until elections were held in
    2000.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Formal Institutions Today</h2>

  <p>Russia has a <i>semipresidential system</i> similar to that of
    France: the president chooses a prime minister who is accountable
    to parliament.</p>

  <p>Unlike in France, parliament's control over the cabinet is more
    limited. A censure (no confidence) vote only requires the
    president to act if a confidence motion is passed twice within
    three months; even then, the president can normally call for new
    elections to the <i lang="ru-Latn">Duma</i> rather than dismissing
    the cabinet.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The President</h2>

      <img src="img/cp06-russia/334px-Vladimir_Putin_-_2006.jpg"
           style="float: right; width: 22.5%"

  <p>The current president of Russia is Vladimir Putin of
    the <em>United Russia</em> party. Putin is in his third term as
    president; he served two terms from 2000&ndash;08, and was elected
    to a third term in 2012 with 63.6% of the vote.

  <p>As in France, if no candidate receives an absolute majority in the
    first ballot, a runoff between the top two candidates takes
    place. Unlike in France, runoffs in Russia have been rare.

  <p>Until 2012, presidents served four-year terms and, like in France,
    could only serve two consecutive terms. Since 2012, presidents now
    serve six-year terms.

     alt="The State Duma chamber.">

  <p>Russia's bicameral parliament is officially known as the <b>Federal Assembly</b>.

  <p>The lower house is known as
    the <b>State Duma</b>. 450 members are elected from across Russia.

  <p>Currently, the Duma is elected via party-list proportional
    representation, with a 7 percent threshold for entry; unlike the
    German MMP system or in Wales and Scotland, there are no
    constituency seats.</p>

  <p>Beginning in 2016, the Duma will return to a <i>parallel
    voting</i> system with 225 proportional seats and 225 seats
    elected from single-member districts; this system was also used
    before the 2007 election.</p>

  <h2>The Federation Council</h2>

    <img src="img/cp06-russia/Federation_Council.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 30%"
     alt="The Federation Council chamber.">

  <p>The upper house is known as the <b>Federation Council</b>. There
    are 170 members, with two members each from the various <i>federal
    subjects</i> of Russia; one is elected by the legislature, while
    the other is appointed by the governor of the territory.

<p>In addition to considering legislation proposed by the Duma, the
  Council also is required to approve presidential decrees of
  states-of-emergency and martial law, and to approve
  certain presidential nominations.

<p>Also, the Chairman of the Federation Council would become acting
  president if the president and prime minister were both
  incapacitated.

<section>
  <h2>The Judiciary</h2>

  <p>Like in Germany and the United States, the Russian constitution
  establishes a Constitutional Court that can review the legality of
  government actions and laws.

  <p>However, the courts in Russia (including the Constitutional
  Court) are widely believed to lack genuine independence from
  political influence, particularly from the president. Putin's
  political opponents are frequently convicted of criminal activities,
  while those suspected of crimes against opposition figures and
  independent journalists are rarely brought to justice.

  <h2>Political Parties in Russia</h2>

<p>Only four parties are currently represented in the State Duma:

  <ul>
    <li><p><b>United Russia</b> is the ruling party, organized by
        Putin and his supporters.
        <li><p>Unlike in most post-Communist countries,
        the <b>Communist Party</b> of Russia is still quite popular
        and has not &ldquo;rebranded.&rdquo;

        <li><p><b>LDPR</b> (formerly the <em>Liberal Democratic Party of
        Russia</em>) is a nationalist party; it is not particularly
            liberal or democratic.</p>

        <li><p><b>A Just Russia</b> historically supported Putin and
          Medvedev as well, but now presents itself as a democratic
            socialist alternative.</p></li>


  </ul>

  <h2>Political Subdivisions</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Russian_Regions-EN.svg"
       style="background: white; width: 35%; float: right"
       alt="Federal subjects of Russia.">

  <p>As Russia is structured as a federal republic, it has many
  subdivisions with varying degrees of autonomy. There are
    85 <b>federal subjects</b> of Russia, which are territories that
    are directly under the federal government.

    <p>Unlike in Germany or the United States, not every federal
      subject has equal powers. The most powerful are the
      22 <b>republics</b>, which are home to ethnic minorities; other
      subdivisions include <i>oblasts</i>, <i>krais</i>, <i>okrugs</i>, and the
      three <i>federal cities</i> (Moscow, St. Petersburg, and
      Sevastapol in disputed Crimea).

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Putinism in Practice</h2>

  <p>Most observers outside of Russia&mdash;and even some within
    it&mdash;think that even though Russia has the trappings of
    democracy, in practice it has an oligarchy or dictatorship headed by
    Vladimir Putin since the late 1990s.

  <p>There is some debate over whether the real source of
    power in the Kremlin during Medvedev's presidency was Medvedev
    himself or Putin. These questions were reinforced when Medvedev
    became Putin's prime minister in 2012.

</section>


<section>
  <h2>The Near Abroad</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Emblem_of_CIS.svg"
       style="width: 25%; border: none; background: transparent; float: right"
       alt="Commonwealth of Independent States emblem.">

  <p>Russia has attempted to maintain its influence in the areas
  formerly under the control of the Soviet Union, and particularly
  those with a large number of Russian speakers (either historically
  or imported under Soviet rule).

<p>The <b>Commonwealth of Independent States</b> was established in
  1991 as the successor of the Soviet Union; in practice, however, the
  CIS is more of a coordinating body than a supranational
  government. However, Russia&mdash;by dominating the CIS&mdash;can
  use it as an instrument to keep control over its neighbors.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Nostalgia for the Soviet Era</h2>


  <p>Many Russians have positive feelings about the old Soviet
    Union. The depth of the crimes of the Soviet era, particularly under
    Lenin and Stalin, is not emphasized, while the victory in
    the <i>Great Patriotic War</i> against Germany (WWII) is
    celebrated. If nothing else, the old Soviet Union was more
    orderly than post-USSR Russia has been.</p>

  <p>The continued support of the Communist Party by a sizable part of
  the Russian population&mdash;at around 20%, much higher than
  anywhere else in Europe&mdash;reflects this nostalgia.</p>

  <h2>The Ukraine Crisis</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/640px-Map_of_the_Crimea.png"
       style="background: white; width: 40%; float: right"
       alt="Map of Crimea">

  <p>Ukraine's pro-Russian ruler <span lang="uk">Viktor
  Yanukovych</span> was ousted in a popular uprising in February 2014.

  <p>The next month, with apparent support from Russian special
    forces disguised as &ldquo;Crimean rebels,&rdquo; the government of
    the peninsula of Crimea declared independence from Ukraine; the next
    day, the &ldquo;independent&rdquo; Republic of Crimea was dissolved
    and annexed by Russia at its request.

    <p>Later in 2014, Kremlin-supported forces in the Donbass region
    in eastern Ukraine launched a rebellion aimed at either greater
    autonomy or becoming part of Russia.

<section>
  <h2>Other Challenges</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><p><b>The economy:</b> Russia's economy remains largely
        state-controlled and inefficient, with many businesses either
        owned by the state or by
        closely-connected <i>oligarchs</i>. Reforms, however, will be
        painful.</p>

        <p>In theory, Russia has vast untapped mineral wealth in
        Siberia and the Arctic, but finding the investment to exploit
          these opportunities remains a challenge.</p>

    <li><p><b>Internal dissent:</b> Although Russians dominate, Russia
    is a multi-ethnic state. Tensions with minority populations,
    particularly in <i>Chechnya</i> and other Muslim-dominated areas,
    have led to terrorism and low-level conflict.
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Will Russia Become Democratic?</h2>

  <p>Although Russia has the political institutions of a
  representative democracy, in practice it is subject to authoritarian
  rule. In many ways, this is similar to many American client states
  during the Cold War, like Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and
    South Korea.

  <p>Those countries eventually became democratic, so there is hope
    that democracy could also take root in Russia. Once Putin retires
    from the political scene, it's possible his successor will be more
    willing to democratize; observers suggested that Medvedev's
    presidency, for example, was more liberal than Putin's despite
    their close alliance.
