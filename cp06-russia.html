  <h2>Geography</h2>
  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Rs-map.png" style="width: 50%; float: right"
       alt="Map of Modern Russia">

  <p>Russia, officially known as the <b>Russian Federation</b>
    (<em lang="ru">Российская Федерация</em>
    or <em lang="ru-Latn">Rossiyskaya Federatsiya</em>), spans across
    the northern part of Asia and the easternmost portion of
    Europe. It is the largest country by area in the world, spanning
    11 time zones.</p>

  <p>However, most of Russia is thinly populated; most Russians live
    in the western and southwestern portions of the country.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Language and Writing</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Soviet_passport.jpg"
       style="width: 25%; float: right"
       alt="Soviet passport, showing Latin and Cyrillic text.">

  <p>Like several other eastern European languages, Russian is written
    in an alphabet based on Greek known as <i>Cyrillic</i>, after
    Saint Cyril, who was responsible for converting many of the Slavs
    to Christianity.

    <p>Some letters are more-or-less the same as in the Latin alphabet
    used in English, while some are different; some Cyrillic letters
    have the same shapes as Latin letters but different meanings.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Culture and Religion</h2>

    <p>Russia and much of eastern Europe historically was under the
      influence of the <i>Orthodox Church</i>, which broke with the
      Roman Catholic Church in 1054 AD.</p>

    <p>Under communism, society was heavily secularized; religious
      sentiment has recovered somewhat since the 1980s.</p>

  <h2>Early History</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><p>7th&ndash;9th centuries CE: Slavic tribes formed
        the <i>Kievan Rus'</i> in what is now western Russia, Belarus,
        and Ukraine.</p></li>

    <li><p>Capital first at Novogorod, moved to Kiev (Ukraine) in 9th
        century.</p></li>

  <h2>Absolutism and Expansion</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Absolutism expanded in Russia as it was in decline elsewhere
      in Europe:
      <ul>
        <li>Romanovs became increasingly autocratic over time.
        <li>Serfdom expanded.
      </ul>
    <li><b>Peter the Great</b> (1682&ndash;1725)
      <ul>
        <li>Inspired by Louis XIV of France.
        <li>Expanded Russian territory, conquering neighboring
          territories and settling Siberia; Russia became world's
          biggest country.
        <li>Sought to &ldquo;Europeanize&rdquo; Russia, founding new
          capital (Saint Petersburg) on the Baltic Sea.
      </ul>
  </ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>19th Century Reform: Too Little, Too Late</h2>

  <p>Napoleon's armies&mdash;although ultimately defeated, thanks
  largely to the harsh Russian winter&mdash;made Russians aware just
  how far behind western Europe their country was. Russians were
  divided between those who wanted to emulate the West more closely
  and those who wanted to stand up for a unique, Slavic culture.

    <p>Meanwhile, the tsars rarely paid much heed to the need for
    political and economic reform. Although the serfs were nominally
    freed under Alexander II in 1861, peasant life was still brutal
    and other political reforms were lacking.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Anarchists and Communists</h2>

<p>The lack of meaningful political reform led to radical movements
  emerging in Russia. Some intellectuals rejected the ideas of the
  state and traditional government entirely. Others favored
  a <b>Marxist</b> revolution to bring about a socialist
  state, but disagreed as to how they might make it come about.</p>

  <p>The secret police within Russia were very effective in rooting
  out revolutionary groups across the spectrum, so many of these
  groups' leaders were forced into exile. One of these groups, the
  Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, would become critical in the
  decades to come.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mensheviks and Bolsheviks</h2>

    <p>Two factions within the Russian SDLP:
      <ul>
        <li><p>Gradualists (<i lang="ru-Latn">Mensheviks</i>): Russia not
          ready for socialism; needed to become capitalist first while
          improving conditions for peasants and workers.
        <li><p>Militants (<i lang="ru-Latn">Bolsheviks</i>): Russia
          needed a direct transition from feudalism to
          socialism. Fused Marx's economic ideas with Lenin's
          political approach of <i>democratic centralism</i>.
      </ul>


</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Russo-Japanese War</h2>

<p>The expanding Russian empire in the east came into conflict with
  Japanese expansion into modern Korea and northern China
  (Manchuria). The Russians thought they could easily defeat Japan,
  but instead suffered a humiliating defeat.</p>

<p>Russians rose up in protest against the tsar, Nicholas II, who was
  forced to offer reforms, including elections to a national
  parliament, the <b lang="ru-Latn">Duma</b>.

<p>While this was a baby step toward mass democracy, Nicholas kept
  real power under his control by making ministers accountable to him,
  not the elected <span lang="ru-Latn">Duma</span>. Few Russians were
  satisfied.

<section>
  <h2>The February Revolution</h2>

<img src="img/cp06-russia/322px-Alexander_Kerensky_LOC_24416.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 25%"
     alt="Alexander Kerensky">

<p>In World War I, Russia was one of the allies that were arrayed against the
  Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary). However, the war went
  very badly for Russia, whose armies again were proven inferior to
  those of their rivals.

<p>In March 1917 (late February under the old Russian calendar),
  moderate politicians forced Nicholas II from power and established
  the <b>Provisional Government</b> under Alexander Kerensky, a social
  democrat. Kerensky, however, vowed to continue the war, an unpopular
  stance among the Russian people.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The October Revolution</h2>

  <p>The Germans hoped to get Russia out of the war by provoking
    continued unrest there; they gave Lenin and several other
    communists free passage through their territory to go to Russia
    and foment revolution.

  <p>The Provisional Government had control of the army, but the
    Bolsheviks organized the <i lang="ru-Latn">soviets</i>&mdash;councils of
    workers, peasants, and soldiers&mdash;to undermine state power.

  <p>In late October on the old Russian calendar (early November),
    Lenin and the St. Petersburg <i lang="ru-Latn">soviet</i> rose up
    and ousted the Provisional Government. They quickly sued for peace
    with Germany in the <i>Treaty of Brest-Litvosk</i> on terms very
    favorable to the Germans.

  <h2>The Civil War and War Communism</h2>

<img src="img/cp06-russia/324px-Lenin_CL.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 17.5%"
     alt="Vladimir Lenin">

  <p>Russian opponents of the Bolsheviks, and World War I allies who
    felt betrayed by Russia's withdrawal from the conflict with
    Germany, waged a civil war to stop the Bolsheviks from gaining
    control of the Russian Empire.  The anti-communist
    &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; were eventually defeated by the
    &ldquo;Reds,&rdquo; but at a heavy cost.

  <p>At the same time the civil war raged, Lenin tried to implement a
    socialist economic system by nationalizing the entire
    economy. Ironically, only American charity saved the Russian
    people under <b>war communism</b> from mass starvation as the
    forced collectivization of agriculture failed miserably.

    <li><p>USSR theoretically a federation of states; in practice,
        Russians called the shots.</p></li>
    <li><p>Failure of war communism led Lenin to adopt the <i>New

          industry and returning most farming, light industry, and
        commerce to private ownership.</p></li>

<h2>Joseph Stalin (1926&ndash;53)</h2>

<img src="img/cp06-russia/CroppedStalin1943.jpg"
     style="float: right; width: 20%"
     alt="Joseph Stalin">

<p>When Joseph Stalin consolidated power in 1926, he began a series
  of <i>purges</i> designed to eliminate the other early Bolshevik
  leaders along with other rivals. Estimates suggest over a million
  people were killed; millions more were imprisoned, exiled, or
  removed from government posts.

  <p>Stalin also initiated a program of <i>dekulakization</i> to bring
  agriculture under state control by killing hundreds of thousands of
  peasant farmers and their families. These policies caused a massive
  famine, leading to between 5 and 8 million deaths.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Stalin in World War II</h2>

  <p>Stalin and Hitler, despite being ideological opponents, secretly
  cooperated early in the war to divide Poland. On Stalin's orders,
  thousands of Poles were massacred by the Soviets, including both
  civilians and prisoners of war.

<p>When Hitler turned on Stalin and invaded, the Soviet military was
  taken by complete surprise; it was also ill-equipped and weak due to
  Stalin's purges. The assault went well initially for the Germans,
  but the failure to capture Moscow and Leningrad quickly led to the
  Soviets being able to regroup in 1942 and turn the tide.

  <p>In total, 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war; over
  two-thirds were civilians.

  <h2>Andropov and Chernenko</h2>

  <p>Brezhnev was succeeded by two short-lived rulers, <b>Yuri
    Andropov</b> (1982&ndash;84) and <b>Konstantin Chernenko</b>
    (1984&ndash;85).

  <p>Andropov realized the depth of the problems facing the Soviet
    Union and began a program of reform and continued arms limitation
    talks with the West, but became seriously ill just months into his
    leadership.

  <p>Chernenko was already terminally ill when he became general
    secretary.</p>

<p>The last Soviet leader was Mikhail Gorbachev. Initially expected to
  continue Andropov's program of gradual reform, he eventually was
  forced by economic circumstances to introduce much more drastic
  changes (<i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i>).

<section>
  <h2>Institutions Under Communism</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Theory: the CPSU and the state were separate
        institutions.</p></li>
    <li><p>Practice: CPSU dominated the state apparatus.</p></li>
    <li><p>General Secretary (<b lang="ru-Latn">gensek</b>) usually

    <li><p>State power vested in <b>Supreme Soviet</b> (legislature)
        and its executive committee, the <i>Presidium</i>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Presidium members and key ministers were typically
        Politburo members. Chairman of the Presidium was technically

<section>
  <h2>Glasnost and Perestroika</h2>

  <p>By the 1980s, it was clear that the Eastern Bloc was unable to
    keep up with the West. The USSR was beset by widespread corruption
    and inefficiency, compounded by worsening public services and
    alcoholism.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev concluded that the Soviet state needed fundamental
    restructuring (<i lang="ru-Latn">perestroika</i>) and greater
    openness to criticism (<i lang="ru-Latn">glasnost</i>). Private
    sector businesses were allowed again, and greater criticism of
    government and party policies was tolerated.</p>

  <p>However, even at the end, Gorbachev wanted to preserve
    Marxism-Leninism and the USSR, at least in some form.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Unintended Consequences</h2>

  <p>The biggest unintended consequence
    of <i lang="ru-Latn">glasnost</i> was the return of nationalism,
    not just in the USSR's republics but also in the Eastern
    Bloc. People under communist rule also became more aware of the
    better lifestyle most Westerners enjoyed and the full extent of
    Stalin's crimes.

  <p>Following Gorbachev's decision to allow the Warsaw Pact countries
    to democratize without Soviet intervention, nationalists in the
    Baltic and Caucasus republics agitated for independence from the
    Russian-dominated USSR.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The August Coup</h2>

  <p>When the CPSU's monopoly on power was removed by Gorbachev,
    nationalist parties won elections in several Soviet republics and
    moved toward independence. Meanwhile, reformist former Politburo
    member Boris Yeltsin became the leader of the Russian Supreme
    Soviet, increasing tension between the Russian and USSR
    governments.

  <p>The final death knell was
  the <a href="http://ezproxy.mga.edu/login?url=http://digital.films.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?aid=27469&xtid=8966">attempted <i>coup</i></a>
  against Gorbachev in August 1991. Although the coup failed and
  Gorbachev was reinstated as president, real power was now in the
  hands of Yeltsin, who had led to opposition to the coup in
  Moscow. The CPSU was dissolved and banned, and most of the republics
  declared independence.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Denouement</h2>

  <p>In December, the four republics that had not declared
    independence did so, effectively abolishing the USSR, and formed
    the <i>Commonwealth of Independent States</i> in its place.

  <p>With no republics left, Gorbachev bowed to the inevitable. With
    his resignation as president, the USSR was officially dissolved on
    December 25, 1991.</p>

  <h2>The Crisis of 1993</h2>

       alt="The Russian White House, after the fighting.">

  <ul>
     <li><p>&ldquo;Shock therapy&rdquo;
        economics led to sharp decline in Yeltsin's approval, tensions with
        the <i>Congress of People's Deputies</i> (parliament).</p></li>
    <li><p>Tensions boiled over in September 1993: Yeltsin tried to
        dissolve the parliament; CPD tried to impeach Yelstin for
        violating the constitution by dissolving parliament.</p></li>
    <li><p>Interior ministry forces loyal to Yeltsin eventually stormed the

  <h2>A New Constitution</h2>

  <p>In the aftermath, a new Constitution was adopted, modeled on that
    of France, strengthening presidential power at the expense of the
    new <i>Federal Assembly</i>.

  <p>However, Yeltsin also got along poorly with the new legislature,
    and he was unable to continue many of his reforms.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Vladimir Putin Takes Power</h2>

  <p>Toward the end of his presidency, Yelstin appointed former KGB
  operative Vladimir Putin as his prime minister and handed increasing
    power over to him as his health continued to deteriorate.</p>

  <p>When Yeltsin resigned from office on December 31, 1999, Putin
    took over as <i>acting president</i> until elections were held in
    2000.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Formal Institutions Today</h2>

  <p>Russia has a <i>semipresidential system</i> similar to that of
    France: the president chooses a prime minister who is accountable
    to parliament.</p>

  <p>Unlike in France, parliament's control over the cabinet is more
    limited. A censure (no confidence) vote only requires the
    president to act if a confidence motion is passed twice within
    three months; even then, the president can normally call for new
    elections to the <i lang="ru-Latn">Duma</i> rather than dismissing
    the cabinet.</p>

  <p>The prime minister and cabinet, like in France, is appointed by
  the president.

  <p>The current prime minister is <b lang="ru-Latn">Dmitry
  Medvedev</b>. He previously served as a cabinet member during
  Putin's first term in office, and was president from 2008&ndash;12.

  <p>In the event of the president's death or resignation from
    office, the prime minister becomes <i>acting president</i> until
    new elections are held within 90 days.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Russia's bicameral parliament officially known as

      <li><p>The lower house is the 450-member <b>State Duma</b>.</p></li>

      <li><p>Duma elected using a <i>parallel voting system</i> since 2016:
          <ul>
            <li>225 seats elected via proportional representation

       style="float: right; width: 30%"
       alt="The Federation Council chamber.">

  <ul>

    <li>Two members from each of Russia's 85 <i>federal subjects</i>:
      <ul>
        <li>One chosen by the legislature.
        <li>One chosen by the governor.
      </ul>
    <li>The president can appoint up to 17 additional members.
    <li>In addition to considering legislation proposed by the Duma, the
      Council also approves presidential decrees of
      states-of-emergency and martial law and approves
        certain presidential nominations.
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>The Judiciary</h2>

  <p>Like in Germany and the United States, the Russian constitution
  establishes a Constitutional Court that can review the legality of
  government actions and laws.

  <p>However, the courts in Russia (including the Constitutional
  Court) are widely believed to lack genuine independence from
  political influence, particularly from the president. Putin's
  political opponents are frequently convicted of criminal activities,
  while those suspected of crimes against opposition figures and
  independent journalists are rarely brought to justice.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Political Parties in Russia</h2>

  <p>Four biggest parties in the State Duma:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><b>United Russia</b> is the ruling party, organized by
        Putin's supporters.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>Unlike in most post-Communist countries, the <b>Communist
        Party</b> of Russia is still quite popular and has not
        &ldquo;rebranded.&rdquo;</p></li>

    <li><p><b>LDPR</b> (formerly the <em>Liberal Democratic Party of
          Russia</em>) is a nationalist party; it is not particularly
        liberal or democratic.</p>

    <li><p><b>A Just Russia</b> historically supported Putin and
        Medvedev too; now presents itself as a left-wing alternative.</p></li>
  </ul>

       style="border: none; width: 50%; float: right"
       alt="Federal subjects of Russia.">

  <p>85 <b>federal subjects</b> of Russia, directly under the federal

  <ul>
    <li>22 <b>republics</b> (typically for minorities)</li>
    <li>46 <i>oblasts</i>
    <li>9 <i>krais</i>

        [in Crimea]</li>
    <li>1 autonomous <i>oblast</i></li>
  </ul>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Putinism in Practice</h2>

  <p>Most observers outside of Russia&mdash;and even some within
    it&mdash;think that even though Russia has the trappings of
    democracy, in practice it has an oligarchy or dictatorship headed by
    Vladimir Putin since the late 1990s.

  <p>There is some debate over whether the real source of
    power in the Kremlin during Medvedev's presidency was Medvedev
    himself or Putin. These questions were reinforced when Medvedev
    became Putin's prime minister in 2012.

</section>


<section>
  <h2>The Near Abroad</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/Emblem_of_CIS.svg"
       style="width: 25%; border: none; background: transparent; float: right"
       alt="Commonwealth of Independent States emblem.">

  <p>Russia has attempted to maintain its influence in the areas
  formerly under the control of the Soviet Union, and particularly
  those with a large number of Russian speakers (either historically
  or imported under Soviet rule).

<p>The <b>Commonwealth of Independent States</b> was established in
  1991 as the successor of the Soviet Union; in practice, however, the
  CIS is more of a coordinating body than a supranational
  government. However, Russia&mdash;by dominating the CIS&mdash;can
  use it as an instrument to keep control over its neighbors.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Nostalgia for the Soviet Era</h2>


  <p>Many Russians have positive feelings about the old Soviet
    Union. The depth of the crimes of the Soviet era, particularly under
    Lenin and Stalin, is not emphasized, while the victory in
    the <i>Great Patriotic War</i> against Germany (WWII) is
    celebrated. If nothing else, the old Soviet Union was more
    orderly than post-USSR Russia has been.</p>

  <p>The continued support of the Communist Party by a sizable part of
  the Russian population&mdash;at around 20%, much higher than
  anywhere else in Europe&mdash;reflects this nostalgia.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Ukraine Crisis</h2>

  <img src="img/cp06-russia/640px-Map_of_the_Crimea.png"
       style="background: white; width: 40%; float: right"
       alt="Map of Crimea">
  <ul>
    <li><p>Ukraine's pro-Russian president <span lang="uk">Viktor
          Yanukovych</span> was ousted in a popular uprising in
          February 2014.</p></li>

    <li><p>Crimea declared independence from Ukraine in March 2014;
        the next day, the &ldquo;independent&rdquo; Republic of Crimea
        was dissolved and annexed by Russia at its request.</p></li>

    <li><p>Later in 2014, Kremlin-supported forces in the Donbass region
        in eastern Ukraine launched a rebellion aimed at either greater
        autonomy or becoming part of Russia.</p></li>

  </ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Other Challenges</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><p><b>The economy:</b> Russia's economy remains largely
        state-controlled and inefficient, with many businesses either
        owned by the state or by closely-connected <i>oligarchs</i>.
        Reforms, however, will be painful.</p>

        <p>In theory, Russia has vast untapped mineral wealth in
        Siberia and the Arctic, but finding the investment to exploit
          these opportunities remains a challenge.</p>

    <li><p><b>Internal dissent:</b> Although Russians dominate, Russia
    is a multi-ethnic state. Tensions with minority populations,
    particularly in <i>Chechnya</i> and other Muslim-dominated areas,
    have led to terrorism and low-level conflict.
  </ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Will Russia Become Democratic?</h2>

  <p>Although Russia has the political institutions of a
  representative democracy, in practice it is subject to authoritarian
  rule. In many ways, this is similar to many American client states
  during the Cold War, like Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and
    South Korea.

  <p>Those countries eventually became democratic, so there is hope
    that democracy could also take root in Russia. Once Putin retires
    from the political scene, it's possible his successor will be more
    willing to democratize; observers suggested that Medvedev's
    presidency, for example, was more liberal than Putin's despite
    their close alliance.
