  <p><strong>Mexico</strong> (<em lang="es-MX">M√©xico</em>;
    officially, <em lang="es-MX">los Estados Unidos Mexicanos</em> or
    the United Mexican States) is the most populous Spanish-speaking
    country in the world, located to the south of the United States
    and north of the Central American countries of Belize and
    Guatemala.</p>

  <p>Like the other indigenous peoples of the Americas (including the
    native Americans), the original settlers of Mexico are descendants
    of hunter-gatherers who came from Asia approximately 15,000 years
    ago.</p>

  <p>Several civilizations thrived in Mexico before the arrival of
    Europeans in 1519. Early civilizations such as the Olmec, Zapotec,
    Teotihuac√°n, and Toltec only left behind myths and archaeological
    evidence, but no writing.</p>

  <p>One of the legacies of these civilizations was the domestication
    of important crops: <em>maize</em> (corn) and, in South America, the
    potato.</p>

  <p>The most advanced civilization were the <strong>Maya</strong>, who built
    large cities in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. They had a
    deep understanding of mathematics and astronomy, and left behind
    writing; however, Mayan civilization was in decline for centuries
    before the Spanish arrived.</p>

  <p>In central Mexico, the Toltec civilization was displaced around
    1300 A.D. by the <strong>Aztecs</strong> (or Mexica), who built
    their capital <strong lang="es-MX">Tenochtitl√°n</strong> on an
    island in the middle of a great lake in a high valley known today
    as the Valley of Mexico.

  <p>The first Europeans to explore Mexico were led by
    the <em lang="es-MX">conquistador</em> <span lang="es-MX">Hern√°n
    Cort√©s</span>, who brought hundreds of Spanish soldiers in ships
    from Cuba in 1519. He was joined by thousands of natives who were
    enemies of the Aztecs.</p>

  <p>Although initially unsuccessful in subjugating the
    Aztecs, <span lang="es-MX">Cort√©s</span> and his allies conquered the
    Aztecs in 1521 and most of the Maya soon thereafter. The center of
    Tenochtitl√°n, including the main temple complex, was leveled and
    its stone was used to build a new city on its ruins known
    as <em lang="es-MX">M√©xico</em>.</p>

  <p>Under Spanish rule, <em>New Spain</em> had a strict social
    hierarchy:
    </p>
<ul>
      <li>
<em lang="es-MX">Peninsulares</em> (Spanish-born).
      </li>
<li>
<em lang="es-MX">Criollos</em> (their "pure" descendants).
      </li>
<li>
<em lang="es-MX">Mestizos</em> (mixed-race).
    </li>
</ul>

  <p>The native peoples were either made serfs or fled to areas where
    the Spanish authorities had limited or no control.</p>


  <p>Over the next three centuries, New Spain spread as far north as
    modern Canada, and as far south as Panama.</p>

  <h2>Independence from Spain</h2>

  <p>Calls for independence began after the American and French
    revolutions. Some supporters of independence, such
    as <span lang="es-MX">Miguel Hidalgo</span>
    and <span lang="es-MX">Jos√© Maria Morelos</span>, who were
    executed by the Spanish authorities, wanted a revolutionary change
    in Mexican society.</p>

  <p>However, it was conservative elements in Mexican society that
    eventually were able to achieve independence; they feared that the
    adoption of 1812 Spanish Constitution (the <em>Constitution of
    Cadiz</em>) would lead to a loss of the privileged position of
    the <em lang="es-MX">criollos</em> in Mexico.</p>

  <p>With the collapse of the empire, most of Central America went its
    own way, leaving Mexico to govern the areas of modern Mexico and
    the American Southwest. A republican constitution was adopted in
    1824, modeled on the American constitution.</p>

  <p>However, rather than stable and peaceful transfers of power,
    Mexico experienced lurches between democracy and dictatorship
    throughout the 19th century as liberal federalists and
    conservative centralizers jockeyed for power.</p>

  <p>The strongman rule of <span lang="es-MX">Antonio L√≥pez de Santa
      Anna</span> was disastrous for Mexico. Santa Anna attempted to
      centralize power, provoking revolts against his government in
      several states.</p>

  <p>The most successful revolt was by the American and Mexican
    settlers in the frontier area of Texas, who demanded their own
    state government, a return to federalism, and legal recognition of
    slavery.</p>

  <p>Santa Anna's superior force suffered a humiliating defeat at the
    hands of the Texans at the Battle of San Jacinto. He was forced to
    recognize Texas' independence‚Äîalthough he reversed himself
    when the Texans freed him to return to Mexico City.</p>

  <p>In 1845, the struggling Republic of Texas was bailed out by the
    American government and was annexed by the United States. American
    president James K. Polk launched a series of provocative
    expeditions by American soldiers into the areas claimed by the
    Republic of Texas along the <span lang="es-MX">R√≠o Grande</span>.</p>

  <p>Border skirmishes gave a pretext for the 1846‚Äì48
    Mexican-American War, which ultimately led to the Mexicans being
    completely defeated and American soldiers marching into Mexico
    City.</p>

  <p>In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), Mexico ceded 529,000
    square miles of territory in exchange for $15 million.  In 1853,
    Mexico agreed to the Gadsden Purchase of an additional 30,000
    square miles for $10 million; this land would allow for a southern
    transcontinental railroad to be constructed on U.S. territory.</p>

  <p>After the Mexican-American War, Santa Anna briefly returned to
    power as dictator from 1853‚Äì55. He was deposed and a new
    constitution was adopted; however, this new constitution led to a
    civil war known as the <em>Reform War</em> from 1857‚Äì60.</p>

  <p>During the Reform War, the president and leader of the liberal
    faction was <span lang="es-MX">Benito Ju√°rez</span>; he supported
    greater separation of church and state in Mexico, as the Catholic
    Church was a very conservative force in Mexican politics.</p>

    France forced <span lang="es-MX">Ju√°rez</span> to flee the capital in
    1863, while claiming still to be the ruler of Mexico.</p>

  <p>The French installed an Austrian prince, Maximilian, as
    emperor. He was never able to fully consolidate his power and was
    executed in 1867 after France withdrew its supporting
    troops; <span lang="es-MX">Ju√°rez</span> was restored to power as

  <p>When <span lang="es-MX">Ju√°rez</span> died in office in 1872,
    other politicians jockeyed for position. The former head of the
    army,
    <span lang="es-MX">Porfirio D√≠az</span>, emerged victorious in
    this struggle. Although he originally took over with the slogan
    ‚Äúno reelection,‚Äù he would effectively rule Mexico directly or
    indirectly from 1876 through 1911.</p>

  <p>During this period, known as
    the <em lang="es-MX">Porfioriato</em>, Mexico had greater
    political stability and economic growth, but the peasantry in
    particular was left behind. This sowed the seeds for revolutionary
    upheaval.</p>

  <p>After promising to retire, <span lang="es-MX">D√≠az</span> attempted
    to run again for president in 1910. A wealthy
    academic, <span lang="es-MX">Francisco Madero</span>, decided to run
    against <span lang="es-MX">D√≠az</span>. When the official results
    were announced, they were clearly fraudulent
    and <span lang="es-MX">Madero</span> called for a revolt.</p>

  <p>The army was unable to put down the rebellion, and
    <span lang="es-MX">D√≠az</span> resigned and fled into
    exile. <span lang="es-MX">Madero</span> was then installed as
    president in 1911.</p>

  <p><span lang="es-MX">Madero</span>, however, was soon beset with
  opposition on both sides: more radical revolutionaries wanted larger
  reforms in Mexican society, while the army
  and <span lang="es-MX">D√≠az</span>'s allies thought he was too
  radical.</p>

  <p>Army general <span lang="es-MX">Victoriano Huerta</span>, with the
    support of the U.S. and Spanish ambassadors,
    ousted <span lang="es-MX">Madero</span> in a <em>coup d'√©tat</em> in
    1913. The <em>coup</em> against <span lang="es-MX">Madero</span> led to
    an all-out civil war among the various factions within

  <p><span lang="es-MX">Huerta</span>'s rule was brief, and was followed

  <p>The United States was drawn directly into the conflict as a
    result of border raids by revolutionary <span lang="es-MX">Pancho
    Villa</span> and others.</p>

  <p>In 1917, the military and a number of political bosses worked

  <p>Under the new constitution, revolutionary goals would be
    accomplished by conservative means‚Äîthus, the Mexican
    Revolution became ‚Äúinstitutionalized.‚Äù</p>

  <p>They established a single-party state with an ‚Äúelected‚Äù
    dictatorship under a single party that eventually became known as
    the <strong>Institutional Revolutionary Party</strong> (PRI).</p>

  <p>Although other political parties were not formally banned, and
    non-PRI candidates held seats in Congress and state legislatures,
    a combination of campaign regulations, bribery, vote rigging, and
    fraudulent vote counting ensured that the PRI won almost all

  <p>Like many other countries, including the social democratic
    countries in Europe, Mexico has a lengthy postwar boom. However,
    in the 1970s, despite being an oil exporter, Mexico spent a ‚Äúlost
    decade‚Äù mired in inflation and economic stagnation that destroyed
    the value of the <span lang="es-MX">peso</span>.</p>

  <p>In the 1980s, the PRI began to liberalize the economy and move
    away from state ownership of industry.</p>


  <p>The 1988 presidential election was a turning point for
    Mexico. Although the PRI's <span lang="es-MX">Carlos
    Salinas</span> ultimately ‚Äúwon‚Äù the election, almost all impartial

  <p>The most consequential of <span lang="es-MX">Salinas</span>'

  <p>His successor, <span lang="es-MX">Ernesto Zedillo</span>

      includes <em>secretaries of state</em> responsible for various
      government activities. Only the attorney general has to be
      approved by the Mexican Senate.</p>

  <p>The most powerful cabinet member is the <em>interior
      secretary</em> (<em lang="es-MX">secretario de
      gobernaci√≥n</em>). This post oversees national security issues
      and is generally seen as the ‚Äústepping stone‚Äù to the
      presidency.</p>

  <p>No vice president; instead, the interior secretary serves as
      the <em lang="es-MX">presidente provisional</em> in the event of the
      president's death, incapacity, or resignation, until Congress
      appoints a successor.</p>

  <p>The national legislature is known as the <strong>Congress of the
      Union</strong>.</p>

  <p>The lower house is known as the <strong>Chamber of Deputies</strong>
    (<em lang="es-MX">C√°mara de Diputados</em>).</p>

  <p>500 members are elected to three-year terms. Since 2018, deputies
    have been allowed to serve up to four terms. (Previously,
    legislators could only serve a single term in each chamber, like
    the president.)</p>

  <p>The most recent elections were held in June 2024.</p>

  <p>300 deputies are elected from single-member districts by
    plurality vote (first-past-the-post). The 200 remaining deputies
    are chosen in five 40-seat multi-state constituencies by closed
    list proportional representation.</p>

  <p>Each state (including the federal district) has at least two
    districts, regardless of population.</p>

  <p>This <strong>parallel voting</strong> system is an example
    of <em>semiproportional representation</em>‚Äîunlike the German
    MMP system, it does not produce fully proportional outcomes.</p>

  <p>The upper house is known as the <strong>Chamber of Senators</strong>
    (<em lang="es-MX">C√°mara de Senadores</em>).</p>

  <p>Senators serve six-year terms; all 128 members are elected at the
    same time as a presidential election takes place.</p>

  <p>Starting with the 2018 election, they have been allowed to serve
    two terms.</p>

  <p>Each state (and the federal district) has three seats in
    the Senate:
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Two seats go to the party that gets the most votes
      (candidates run on a joint ticket).
    </li>
    <li>One seat goes to the party that gets the second-most votes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>32 additional seats are elected nationwide based on their party's
    share of the total vote. Like the Chamber of Deputies, this makes
    the Mexican Senate <em>semiproportional</em>.</p>

  <p>As a federal republic, Mexico has 31 constituent states

    district (<em lang="es-MX">distrito federal</em>) for the capital,
    Mexico City.</p>

  <p>Under the unified rule of the PRI, states had little real
    autonomy. As the PRI's domination has broken down, states led by
    opposition parties have been able to assert greater independence
    from the federal government.</p>

  politics, at least for now.</p>

  <p>There are also a number of minor parties; the Citizens' Movement
  (<em lang="es-MX">Movimiento Ciudadano</em>) controls one state
  governorship and several seats in the Congress.</p>

  <!--
  <p>Other parties include the Labor Party (PT, <i lang="es-MX">Partido
      del Trabajo</i>) and the New Alliance Party (PANAL).</p>
  -->

  <p>Minor parties typically join a <em>coalition</em> with one of the
    leading parties, agreeing to support a major party's presidential
    candidate and work together to elect members of Congress.</p>

  <p>This does not mean, however, that the ‚Äúcoalition‚Äù
    will work together after the election; it's more like a
    vote-sharing agreement than a parliamentary coalition.</p>

  <p>Although Mexico does have some drug abuse among its own
  population, the major cause of the Drug War is demand for illegal
    drugs in the U.S.</p>

  <p>In some areas of Mexico, drug cartels actively contest control of
    the cities and countryside with government authorities.</p>

  <p>Although the United States government helps the Mexican
    government financially and with supplies, the opportunities for
    profit in the drug trade are so great that it's unlikely to be
    stopped anytime soon.</p>
