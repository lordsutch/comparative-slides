  <h2>Geography</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Mexico_topographic_map-blank.svg"
       style="width: 60%; float: right"
       alt="Map of the states of Mexico, including the federal district.">

  <p><b>Mexico</b> (<i lang="es">México</i>;
  officially, <i lang="es">los Estados Unidos Mexicanos</i> or the
  United Mexican States) is the most populous Spanish-speaking country
  in the world, located to the south of the United States and north of
  the Central American countries of Belize and Guatemala.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Pre-Colombian History</h2>

  <p>Like the other indigenous peoples of the Americas (including the
  native Americans), the original settlers of Mexico are descendants
    of hunter-gatherers who came from Asia approximately 15,000 years ago.</p>

  <p>Several civilizations thrived in Mexico before the arrival of
    Europeans in 1519. Early civilizations such as the Olmec, Zapotec,
    Teotihuacán, and Toltec only left behind myths and archaeological
    evidence, but no writing.</p>

  <p>One of the legacies of these civilizations was the domestication
    of important crops: <i>maize</i> (corn) and, in South America, the
    potato.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Maya and the Aztecs</h2>

  <p>The most advanced civilization were the <b>Maya</b>, who built
    large cities in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. They had a
    deep understanding of mathematics and astronomy, and left behind
    writing; however, Mayan civilization was in decline for centuries
    before the Spanish arrived.</p>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/640px-Murales_Rivera_-_Markt_in_Tlatelolco_3.jpg"
       alt="Mural of Tenochtitlán at its height."
       style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>In central Mexico, the Toltec civilization was displaced around
    1300 A.D. by the <b>Aztecs</b> (or Mexica), who built their
    capital <b>Tenochtitlán</b> on an island in the middle of a great
    lake in a high valley known today as the Valley of Mexico.

    <!--
  <p>Both the Maya and the Aztecs practiced human
    sacrifice&mdash;often of the neighboring peoples they subjugated
    or fought. -->

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Cortés and the Aztecs</h2>

  <p>The first Europeans to explore Mexico were led by
  the <i lang="es">conquistador</i> Hernán Cortés, who brought
  hundreds of Spanish soldiers in ships from Cuba in 1519. He was
    joined by thousands of natives who were enemies of the Aztecs.

  <p>Although initially unsuccessful in subjugating the Aztecs, Cortés
    and his allies conquered the Aztecs in 1521 and most of the Maya
    soon thereafter. The center of Tenochtitlán, including the main
    temple complex, was leveled and its stone was used to build a new
    city on its ruins known as <i>México</i>.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Colonial Era</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Viceroyalty_of_the_New_Spain_1800_(without_Philippines).png"
       alt="Map of the extent of New Spain in 1800"
       style="float: right; border: none; width: 40%">

  <p>Under Spanish rule, <i>New Spain</i> had a strict social
    hierarchy:
    <ul>
      <li><i lang="es">Peninsulares</i> (Spanish-born).
      <li><i lang="es">Criollos</i> (their "pure" descendants).
      <li><i lang="es">Mestizos</i> (mixed-race).
    </ul>

  <p>The native peoples were either made serfs or fled to areas where
    the Spanish authorities had limited or no control.

  <p>Over the next three centuries, New Spain spread as far north as
    modern Canada, and as far south as Panama.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Independence from Spain</h2>

  <p>Calls for independence began after the American and French
  revolutions. Some supporters of independence, such
  as <span lang="es">Miguel Hidalgo</span> and <span lang="es">José
  Maria Morelos</span>, who were executed by the Spanish authorities,
  wanted a revolutionary change in Mexican society.</p>

  <p>However, it was conservative elements in Mexican society that
    eventually were able to achieve independence; they feared that the
    adoption of 1812 Spanish Constitution (the <i>Constitution of
      Cadiz</i>) would lead to a loss of the privileged position of
    the <i lang="es">criollos</i> in Mexico.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The First Empire</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Emperor_Agustin_I_kroningsportret.jpeg" alt="Agustín de Iturbide"
       style="float: right; width: 30%">
  
  <p>Although the leaders of the revolution,
    including <span lang="es">Agustín de Iturbide</span>, wanted a
    Mexican Empire under monarchical rule&mdash;and Iturbide himself
    briefly ruled as <span lang="es">Agustín I</span>&mdash;the empire
    was overthrown and a federal republic was established in its
    place.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Life After Independence</h2>

  <p>With the collapse of the empire, most of Central America went its
    own way, leaving Mexico to govern the areas of modern Mexico and
    the American Southwest. A republican constitution was adopted in
    1824, modeled on the American constitution.

  <p>However, rather than stable and peaceful transfers of power,
    Mexico experienced lurches between democracy and dictatorship
    throughout the 19th century as liberal federalists and
    conservative centralizers jockeyed for power.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Santa Anna</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Santaanna1.jpeg" alt="Antonio López de Santa Anna"
       style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>The strongman rule of <span lang="es">Antonio López de Santa
    Anna</span> was disastrous for Mexico. Santa Anna attempted to
    centralize power, provoking revolts against his government in
    several states.

  <p>The most successful revolt was by the American and Mexican
    settlers in the frontier area of Texas, who demanded their own
    state government, a return to federalism, and legal recognition of
    slavery.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Texas Independence</h2>

  <p>Santa Anna's superior force suffered a humiliating defeat at the
    hands of the Texans at the Battle of San Jacinto. He was forced to
    recognize Texas' independence&mdash;although he reversed himself
    when the Texans freed him to return to Mexico City.</p>

  <p>In 1845, the struggling Republic of Texas was bailed out by the
    American government and was annexed by the United States. American
    president James K. Polk launched a series of provocative
    expeditions by American soldiers into the areas claimed by the
    Republic of Texas along the <span lang="es">Río Grande</span>.</p>
    
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Territorial Losses</h2>

  <p>Border skirmishes gave a pretext for the 1846&ndash;48
    Mexican-American War, which ultimately led to the Mexicans being
    completely defeated and American soldiers marching into Mexico
    City.</p>

  <p>In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), Mexico ceded 529,000
    square miles of territory in exchange for $15 million.  In 1853,
    Mexico agreed to the Gadsden Purchase of an additional 30,000
    square miles for $10 million; this land would allow for a southern
    transcontinental railroad to be constructed on U.S. territory.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Juárez and the Reform War</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Benito_Juarez_Presidente.jpg"
       alt="Photograph of Benito Juarez"
       style="float: right; width: 30%">
  
  <p>After the Mexican-American War, Santa Anna briefly returned to power as
  dictator from 1853&ndash;55. He was deposed and a new constitution
  was adopted; however, this new constitution led to a civil war known
    as the <i>Reform War</i> from 1857&ndash;60.

  <p>During the Reform War, the president and leader of the liberal
    faction was <span lang="es">Benito Juárez</span>; he supported
    greater separation of church and state in Mexico, as the Catholic
    Church was a very conservative force in Mexican politics.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Second Empire</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Maximilian_emperor_of_Mexico.jpg"
       alt="Photograph of Maximilian I"
       style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>An invasion backed by <span lang="fr">Napoléon III</span> of
    France forced <span lang="es">Juárez</span> to flee the capital in
    1863, while claiming still to be the ruler of Mexico.</p>

  <p>The French installed an Austrian prince, Maximilian, as
    emperor. He was never able to fully consolidate his power and was
    executed in 1867 after France withdrew its supporting
    troops; <span lang="es">Juárez</span> was restored to power as
    president.
    
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Porfiriato</h2>

    <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Porfirio_Diaz_in_uniform.jpg"
       alt="Photograph of Porfirio Díaz"
       style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>When <span lang="es">Juárez</span> died in office in 1872, other
  politicians jockeyed for position. The former head of the army,
    <span lang="es">Porfirio Díaz</span>, emerged victorious in this
    struggle. Although he originally took over with the slogan
    &ldquo;no reelection,&rdquo; he would effectively rule Mexico
    directly or indirectly from 1876 through 1911.

  <p>During this period, known as the <i lang="es">Porfioriato</i>,
  Mexico had greater political stability and economic growth, but the
  peasantry in particular was left behind. This sowed the seeds for
    revolutionary upheaval.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Fall of Díaz</h2>

  <p>After promising to retire, <span lang="es">Díaz</span> attempted
    to run again for president in 1910. A wealthy
    academic, <span lang="es">Francisco Madero</span>, decided to run
    against <span lang="es">Díaz</span>. When the official results
    were announced, they were clearly fraudulent
    and <span lang="es">Madero</span> called for a revolt.

  <p>The army was unable to put down the rebellion, and
    <span lang="es">Díaz</span> resigned and fled into
    exile. <span lang="es">Madero</span> was then installed as
    president in 1911.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Revolution Begins</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/755px-Francisco_I_Madero-retouched.jpg"
       alt="Photograph of Pancho Villa and other revolutionaries."
       style="float: right; width: 35%">
  
  <p><span lang="es">Madero</span>, however, was soon beset with
  opposition on both sides: more radical revolutionaries wanted larger
  reforms in Mexican society, while the army
    and <span lang="es">Díaz</span>'s allies thought he was too
  radical.</p>

  <p>Army general <span lang="es">Victoriano Huerta</span>, with the
    support of the U.S. and Spanish ambassadors,
    ousted <span lang="es">Madero</span> in a <i>coup d'état</i> in
    1913. The <i>coup</i> against <span lang="es">Madero</span> led to
    an all-out civil war among the various factions within
    Mexico.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Revolutionary Era</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Villa_toma.jpg"
       alt="Photograph of Pancho Villa and other revolutionaries."
       style="float: right; width: 35%">
  
  <p><span lang="es">Huerta</span>'s rule was brief, and was followed
    by a struggle between radical reformers and proponents of a return
    to orderly government.</p>

  <p>The United States was drawn directly into the conflict as a
    result of border raids by revolutionary <span lang="es">Pancho
      Villa</span> and others.</p>

  <p>In 1917, the military and a number of political bosses worked
    together to try to end the fighting by writing a new
    constitution that would placate both sides.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>One-Party Rule</h2>

  <p>Under the new constitution, revolutionary goals would be
    accomplished by conservative means&mdash;thus, the Mexican
    Revolution became &ldquo;institutionalized.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They established a single-party state with an
    &ldquo;elected&rdquo; dictatorship under a single party that
    eventually became known as the <b>Institutional Revolutionary
    Party</b> (PRI).</p>

  <p>Although other political parties were not formally banned, and
    non-PRI candidates held seats in Congress and state legislatures, a
    combination of campaign regulations, bribery, vote rigging, and
    fraudulent vote counting ensured that the PRI won almost all
    elections of consequence.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Socialism and Corporatism</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/373px-Lazaro_cardenas2.jpg"
       alt="Photograph of Lázaro Cárdenas"
       style="float: right; width: 25%">

  <p><span lang="es">Lázaro Cárdenas</span> oriented Mexico toward
    socialism under his presidency. He nationalized the oil industry,
    creating <i lang="es">Pemex</i>, and several others as well.  He
    also promoted <i>land reform</i>, breaking up many of the large
    agricultural estates (<i lang="es">haciendas</i>) and creating
    cooperatives in their place.</p>

  <p><span lang="es">Cárdenas</span> also promoted
    a <i>corporatist</i> structure in Mexico, where interest groups
    would participate directly in government through the ruling party. This
    made it more a coalition of interest groups
    representing various sectors of society than a traditional party.
    
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The 1970s and 1980s</h2>

  <p>Like many other countries, including the social democratic
    countries in Europe, Mexico has a lengthy postwar boom. However,
    in the 1970s, despite being an oil exporter, Mexico spent a
    &ldquo;lost decade&rdquo; mired in inflation and economic
    stagnation that destroyed the value of
    the <span lang="es">peso</span>.

  <p>In the 1980s, the PRI began to liberalize the economy and move
    away from state ownership of industry.

  <p>The 1988 presidential election was a turning point for
    Mexico. Although the PRI's <span lang="es">Carlos Salinas</span>
    ultimately &ldquo;won&rdquo; the election, almost all impartial
    observers believed it was only due to fraud on a massive scale.
 
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Modern Era</h2>

  <p><span lang="es">Salinas</span> negotiated Mexico's accession to
    the <b>North American Free Trade Agreement</b> (NAFTA) with Canada
    and the United States, and introduced modest political reforms.

  <p>The most consequential of <span lang="es">Salinas</span>'
    reforms, ironically, was replacing the corrupt and PRI-dominated
    Federal Electoral Commission with a more independent agency.
    
  <p>His successor, <span lang="es">Ernesto Zedillo</span>
    (1994&ndash;2000), despite a serious economic crisis at the
    beginning of his term, continued the trend toward privatization of
    state-owned businesses.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Rise of the PAN</h2>

  <ul>
    <p>Electoral reforms since 1988 made elections fairer and more
      competitive, culminating in election of <span lang="es">Vicente
      Fox</span> of the center-right <b>National Action Party</b>
      (PAN) in 2000.

    <p>In 2006, PAN candidate <span lang="es">Felipe Calderón</span>
      won the presidency narrowly over left-wing
      candidate <span>Andrés Manuel López Obrador</span> (PRD) in a
      heavily disputed election.
      
  </ul>
    
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Presidency</h2>

<img src="img/cp09-mexico/373px-Presidente_Enrique_Pena_Nieto._Fotografia_oficial.jpg"
     alt="Photograph of Enrique Peña Nieto."
     style="float: right; width: 25%">

<p>Mexican presidents are elected by nationwide popular vote
  with <i>no</i> runoff requirement; in recent elections, this has
  meant that several presidents have taken office with only minority
  support.

<p>The president serves a six-year term (the <i lang="es">sexenio</i>)
  and can only serve one term; presidents are &ldquo;lame ducks&rdquo;
  the day they are elected.

<p>The current president is Enrique Peña Nieto of the PRI, who
  received 39.2% of the vote, since December 1, 2012.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Presidential Cabinets</h2>

  <p>President chooses a <i>cabinet</i> that includes <i>secretaries
    of state</i> responsible for various government activities. Only
    the attorney general has to be approved by the Mexican Senate.

  <p>The most powerful cabinet member is the <i>interior secretary</i>
      (<i lang="es">secretario de gobernación</i>). This post oversees
      national security issues and is generally seen as the
      &ldquo;stepping stone&rdquo; to the presidency.</p>

  <p>No vice president; instead, the interior secretary serves as
      the <i lang="es">presidente provisional</i> in the event of the
      president's death, incapacity, or resignation, until Congress
      appoints a successor.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Chamber of Deputies</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/640px-Mexico_Chamber_of_Deputies_backdrop.jpg"
       alt="Mexican Chamber of Deputies"
       style="float: right; width: 40%">

  <p>The national legislature is known as the <b>Congress of the
      Union</b>.</p>

  <p>The lower house is known as the <b>Chamber of Deputies</b>
    (<i lang="es">Cámara de Diputados</i>).</p>

  <p>500 members are elected to three-year terms. Beginning in 2018,
    deputies will be allowed to serve up to four terms.

  <p>The most recent elections were held in July 2015.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Electoral System</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Circunscripciones_2006.svg"
       style="float: right; background: transparent; width: 30%; border: none"
       alt="Multistate constituencies for the Chamber of Deputies.">

  <p>300 deputies are elected from single-member districts by
    plurality vote (first-past-the-post). The 200 remaining deputies
    are chosen in five 40-seat multi-state constituencies by closed
    list proportional representation.</p>
  
  <p>Each state (including the federal district) has at least two
    districts, regardless of population.</p>

  <p>This <b>parallel voting</b> system is an example
    of <i>semiproportional representation</i>&mdash;unlike the German
    MMP system, it does not produce fully proportional outcomes.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Chamber of Senators</h2>

  <img src="img/cp09-mexico/Mexican_Senate.jpg"
       style="float: right; width: 40%"
       alt="Front of the Mexican Senate chamber.">

  <p>The upper house is known as the <b>Chamber of Senators</b>
    (<i lang="es">Cámara de Senadores</i>).</p>

  <p>Senators serve six-year terms; all 128 members are elected at the
    same time as a presidential election takes place.
  <p>Starting in 2018, they will be able to serve two terms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Senate Elections</h2>
  
  <p>Each state (and the federal district) has three seats in
    the Senate:
    <ul>
      <li>Two seats go to the party that gets the most votes
        (candidates run on a joint ticket).
      <li>One seat goes to the party that gets the second-most votes.
    </ul>

  <p>32 additional seats are elected nationwide based on their party's
    share of the total vote. Like the Chamber of Deputies, this makes
    the Mexican Senate <i>semiproportional</i>.</p>

</section>


<section>
  <h2>States of Mexico</h2>

<img src="img/cp09-mexico/Political_divisions_of_Mexico-en.svg"
     style="float: right; width: 45%; border: none"
     alt="Map of the states of Mexico, including the federal district.">

  <p>As a federal republic, Mexico has 31 constituent states
  (<i lang="es">estados</i>). There is also a separate federal district
  (<i lang="es">distrito federal</i>) for the capital, Mexico
  City.</p>

  <p>Under the unified rule of the PRI, states had little real
  autonomy. As the PRI's domination has broken down, states
  led by opposition parties have been able to assert greater
  independence from the federal government.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Major Political Parties</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><img src="img/cp09-mexico/PRI_Party_(Mexico).svg"
         style="float:right; height:2em; border: none; background:
         transparent" alt="PRI logo">The Institutional Revolutionary
         Party (PRI): the former ruling party; generally considered to
         be centrist but with elements of both the left and
         right.</li>

<li><p><img src="img/cp09-mexico/PAN_Party_(Mexico).svg"
         style="float:right; height:2em; border: none; background: transparent"
         alt="PAN logo">
The National Action Party (PAN): the party that controlled the
    presidency from 2000&ndash;12. On the political center-right;

<li><p><img src="img/cp09-mexico/PRD_logo_(Mexico).svg"
         style="float:right; height:2em; border:none; background: transparent"
         alt="PRD logo">
The Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD): generally
  left-of-center and social democratic in orientation. Founded by
  <span lang="es">Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas</span>, son
  of <span lang="es">Lázaro</span> and &ldquo;loser&rdquo; of the 1988
  presidential election.

</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Minor Parties</h2>

  <p>There are also a number of minor parties; both the Citizens'
    Movement (<i lang="es">Movimiento Ciudadano</i>) and the Green
    Party (PVEM) control one state governor's seat each.</p>

  <p>Other parties include the Labor Party (PT, <i lang="es">Partido
      del Trabajo</i>) and the New Alliance Party (PANAL).</p>

  <p>Minor parties often join a <i>coalition</i> with one of the PRI,
    PAN, or PRD, agreeing to support a major party's presidential
    candidate and work together to elect members of Congress.</p>

  <p>This does not mean, however, that the &ldquo;coalition&rdquo;
    will work together after the election; it's more like a
    vote-sharing agreement.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Challenge of Development</h2>

  <p>Mexico is still a developing country, with widespread rural
  poverty. Although the PRI promised to spread the country's oil
  wealth to the whole nation, that didn't really happen.

  <p>Although privatization since the 1980s has led to greater
  economic growth, many of the benefits have fallen into the hands of
  politically-connected businessmen rather than the public at
  large. <span lang="es">Carlos Slim</span> became the richest man in
  the world, in part due to the privatization
  of <span lang="es">Telmex</span> in 1990.

  <p>The lack of economic opportunity in Mexico has led to many
    younger Mexicans better seeking economic opportunities in the
    United States, often working illegally to help support family back
    home.

  <h2>Indigenous Peoples</h2>

       alt="Subcomandante Marcos, pictured on horseback."
       style="float: right; width: 30%">
  
  <p>Like in many Latin American countries,
    the <i lang="es">criollo</i> and <i lang="es">mestizo</i>
    populations have historically held the dominant positions in
    Mexican society.

  <p>Rural, predominantly native communities have been left behind by
  economic development. At times this has led to civil unrest and
  uprisings against the government, most notably
  the <span lang="es">Zapatista</span> rebellion led by

  <h2>The War on Drugs</h2>

       style="float: right; width: 30%">

  <p>Although Mexico does have some drug abuse among its own
  population, the major cause of the Drug War is demand for illegal
  drugs in the U.S.

  <p>In some areas of Mexico, drug cartels actively
    contest control of the cities and countryside with government
    authorities.

  <p>Although the United States government helps the Mexican
  government financially and with supplies, the opportunities for
  profit in the drug trade are so great that it's unlikely to be
  stopped anytime soon.

      <p><b lang="es">Pemex:</b> The state-owned Mexican oil company
        is a symbol of national pride and independence, but is
        woefully inefficient and needs modernization. Outside
        investment from the United States and other countries could
        turn <span lang="es">Pemex</span> around, but would be
        politically unpopular.</p>

    <li><p><b>Globalization and NAFTA:</b> It remains unclear whether
    developing countries like Mexico will benefit from free trade and
        allowing greater foreign investment in the economy.
