  <h2>Comparative Politics and Political Science</h2>

  <p><em>Political science</em> is the social science that is devoted to
    the study of politics and government.</p>

  <p>Political science emerged as a distinct discipline in the 19th
    century from the study of economics, history, and philosophy.</p>

  <p>Other modern social sciences include economics, geography,
    psychology, and sociology.</p>

  <h2>What is Comparative Politics?</h2>

  <p>Comparative politics is the area of political science that seeks
    to understand how politics and government work <em>within</em>
    particular countries.</p>

  <p>The term <em>comparative</em> is used because we are making
    comparisons with how other countries' political systems work.</p>

  <h2>Other Fields</h2>

  <p>The most obviously similar field of political science is
    called <em>international relations</em>.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Comparative politics focuses mainly on politics and
    government <em>within</em> a particular country
    or <em>nation-state</em>.</li>

  <li>International relations focuses on the interactions
    <em>between</em> countries and nation-states, including themes like
    war and conflict, international trade and economics, and human
    rights.</li>

  <li>At MGA, our introductory course on international relations is
    called Global Issues, POLS 2401.</li>

</ul>

  <p>Comparative politics is also similar to the study of American
    politics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>American politics is the study of politics and
    government <em>within</em> the United States (and its political
    subdivisions).</li>

  <li>To a non-American (and even some American political scientists),
    the study of American politics would be seen as <em>part</em> of the
    study of comparative politics.</li>

</ul>

  <h2>The Nation-State</h2>

  <p>The building block of comparative politics is what political
    scientists call the <em>nation-state</em> (or <em>modern
    state</em>).</p>

  <p>Nation states began to emerge in 17th Century Europe,
  as <em>feudalism</em> gave way to a more centralized system of
  government where most power rested with the king/queen and his
  or her advisors.</p>

  <p>Some of these states were more <em>absolutist</em> than others: the
    power of British monarchs was reined in by aristocrats and wealthy
    commoners, while French monarchs ruled with an iron fist.</p>

  <h2>Nation-States in the 19th and 20th Centuries</h2>

  <p>The Napoleonic Wars led to the emergence of many more
  nation-states over the next century, as a sense of shared national
  identity led some empires to fall apart while small kingdoms and
    princedoms were consolidated.</p>

<ul>

  <li>The emergence of Germany and Italy as unified states.</li>
  <li>The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires.</li>
  <li>The breakdown of Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule in the
    Americas.</li>
  <li>British settler colonies like Canada and Australia develop a
    sense of national identity distinct from Britain.</li>

</ul>
</section>

  <h2>Consolidating the Nation-State</h2>

<p>Creating the shared identity of a single nation and maintaining it
  over the years can be challenging.</p>

<ul>
  <li>National identity sometimes forged through conquest or war.
  </li>
<li>Spread of a unifying national language, religion, or culture.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some countries are still trying to forge a shared identity, while
  others failed to do so, like the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia which
  collapsed in the 1990s.

  <h2>What Do We Compare?</h2>

  <p>Various <em>institutions</em> form the basis of governing
  nation-states.</p>

  <p>In most modern states, the basic institutions are laid out in a
  written <em>constitution</em> that establishes the scope and powers of
    government institutions.</p>

  <p>In some modern states, the constitution is ‚Äúunwritten‚Äù or
    not a single document, such as Britain and Israel.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Presidential Institutions</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-10.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-10.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Modern democracies generally are classified by relationship
    between the <em>executive</em> and the <em>legislature</em>.</p>

  <p>In a <em>presidential</em> system like the United States or Mexico,
    the executive (president) is elected separately from the
    legislature, and can only be removed under exceptional
    circumstances. The role of <em>head of state</em> and the role
    of <em>head of government</em> is vested in the president.</p>

</section>

<section>

  <h2>Parliamentary Institutions</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-11.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-11.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>In a <em>parliamentary</em> system like Britain or Germany, voters
    choose representatives in parliament (the legislature) who then
    choose a <em>prime minister</em> and <em>cabinet</em> who serve as the
    executive as long as they maintain the <em>confidence</em> of a
    majority of parliament.</p>

  <p>The prime minister serves as the <em>head of government</em> but not
    the <em>head of state</em>.</p>

</section>

  <h2>Heads of State in Parliamentary Systems</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-12.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-12.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Parliamentary systems without a monarch (like Germany's or
    Israel's) have a president who normally serves as
    a <em>figurehead</em> and tends to have little political power.</p>

  <p>Other parliamentary systems, like in Britain and Sweden, assign
  this role to the monarch or his/her representative, who by law or
  tradition does not exercise political power.</p>

</section>

<section>

  <h2>Other Key Institutional Choices</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-13.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-13.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

<ul>

  <li>Are there multiple legislative chambers?</li>

  <li>How are the powers of the legislative chambers balanced? Does one
    chamber dominate?</li>

  <li>How are members of the legislature elected?</li>

  <li>How powerful are bureaucrats?</li>

  <li>How centralized is power in the nation-state? Does it have
    a <em>unitary</em> system, a <em>federal</em> system, or something in
    between?</li>

</ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Proportionality</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-14.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-14.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Many democracies have more than two major parties. Often this
    reflects the electoral system:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
<em>Proportional representation</em> allows smaller parties to
        have a better chance of gaining seats and influence.
      </li>
<li>
<em>Plurality elections</em> make it hard for small or
        geographically dispersed parties to succeed.</li>
    </ul>


</section>

<section>
  <h2>Multiparty Systems</h2>

<audio controls="controls" data-autoplay="autoplay" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-15.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus">
<source data-src="audio/cp-intro/cp-intro-15.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

  <p>Other reasons for multiparty systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regionalism: some groups may not feel integrated into the
    nation-state and seek autonomy or independence through their own
    parties.</li>

  <li>Divisions in society: old and new debates in society may shape
  political discourse, including economic and class divisions,
  urban-rural divisions, and secular-religious divisions
  (<em>anti-clericalism</em>).

</li>
</ul>
