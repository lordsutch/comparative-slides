  <p>The Federal Republic of Germany (German: <em lang="de">Bundesrepublik

  Europe, occupying the north central portion of the continent.

  <p>Today it includes 16 states (German: <em lang="de">LÃ¤nder</em>), three of
    which are &ldquo;city-states&rdquo; (Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen).

  <ul>
    <li>Most of Germany was never under Roman rule.
    <li>Germanic tribes invaded Rome, led to empire's collapse in
      western Europe.
    <li>Germanic leaders adopted many Roman customs.
    <li><b>Charlemagne</b> briefly created an empire ruling much of

  <p>Charlemagne's empire was eventually divided among his three
    grandsons in 843 A.D.:

    <ul>
      <li>Charles ended up with most of what became modern France.
      <li>Louis ended up with most of modern Germany and Austria.
      <li>Lothair got the bits in the middle: northern Italy,
        Switzerland, the Netherlands, and land along the Rhine (today
        called <i>Alsace-Lorraine</i>) that Germany and France have
        squabbled over ever since.

  <p>The &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; eventually became synonymous with
    Germany. Emperors often had little authority outside their home
    kingdom or duchy. Rather than consolidating power, the various
    territories became more independent over time.</p>

    <p>Germany in the 1500s became increasingly divided because of the
      actions of <b>Martin Luther</b>, a Catholic priest who protested
      what he saw as the corruption of the Church.

    <p>The <i>Protestant</i> faith took hold in many of the northern
      and eastern states, while Catholicism remained strong in the
      south and west, particularly in the lands under the control of
      the <b>Habsburg</b> dynasty.</p>

  <p>Wars broke out across Europe as Catholic rulers attempted to
  reunite the faith by arms, while Protestant rulers attempted to
    resist domination by the Catholic Church.</p>

  <p>The conflict was particularly vicious in Germany, where Catholic
    and Protestant territories were intermixed. The rule
    of <i lang="la">cuius regio, eius religio</i> settled the conflict
    for a time, but renewed conflict led to the <b>Thirty Years
    War</b>.

  <p>The war left Germany fragmented into over 300 states, all of
    which had effective sovereignty; emperor mostly powerless.

    centuries.</p>

  <p>The Napoleonic Wars swept across Germany in the early 19th
    century. Much of Germany was united under
    Napoleon's <i>Confederation of the Rhine</i>, although this was
    largely a puppet state under Napoleon's rule.</p>

  <p>Napoleon's defeat led to the creation of the <i>German
      Confederation</i>, a similar arrangement with many of the former
      territories rationalized; only about 40 states remained of the
      over 300 that formed the old Holy Roman Empire. A stronger
      feeling of German nationalism had also emerged.

  <p>Prussia and Austria were the two largest states in the German
    Confederation. Prussia wanted a Germany <i>without</i> Austria and

  <p>Through a series of wars, the Prussian

      most of the German territories, except Austria, into the

  <p>Unlike Britain and France, Germany did not become fully
    democratic; instead, the Junker aristocracy and the emperor
    (<b lang="de">Kaiser</b>) ruled, although
    the <i lang="de">Reichstag</i> did have some limited powers.

  <p>Bismarck tried to forestall the development of the German SPD
  (Social Democratic Party) by offering social programs to the working
  class on his terms, effectively establishing a basic welfare state
  years before Britain and France did.</p>

  <p>Democracy might have emerged gradually as it had in Britain, but
    war would again intervene.</p>

  <p>The <i>Balance of Power</i> system that had largely kept the
  peace in Europe collapsed in 1914 with the assassination of Archduke
  Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo (modern Bosnia). Germany

  <p>The war devastated the German economy and eventually the Kaiser
    was deposed. Adding insult to injury, the peace settlement at
      <b lang="fr">Versailles</b> blamed Germany for the war and demanded huge
    reparations be paid to the victorious allies, further crippling
    the economy.  Germany also had to give up territory along its

  <p>The German people were blindsided by the defeat; imperial
    propaganda had portrayed the war as going much better for Germany
    than it really was. Many Germans believed they had been betrayed by
    disloyal Germans, rather than losing on the battlefield.

  <p>Germany was left to pick up the pieces and establish a new
    <i>republican</i> government, the <b>Weimar Republic</b>. Germans
    had no real experience with democracy and many wanted a return to
    monarchy&mdash;or at least the strong rule they associated with it.</p>

  <p>Although Weimar eventually solved the problem
    of <i>hyperinflation</i>, the mainstream political parties
    squabbled and many Germans yearned for strong rule. Many Germans
    looked to the ideas of German thinker Karl Marx as the answer, and
    supported a Communist takeover, like what had happened in 1917 in
    Russia.</p>

  <p>Others, who bought the <i lang="de">Dolchstoss</i> myth, looked to the far
    right <b>National Socialist German Workers Party</b>, who combined
    socialist rhetoric with extreme German nationalism. Unlike the
    Communists, they also had a charismatic leader: Adolph
    Hitler. They came to be known as the <i>Nazis</i>.

  <p>In 1933, despite failing to gain a majority of the vote or seats
  in the Reichstag, Hitler and his supporters successfully conned the
  leaders of the <i>Center Party</i> into agreeing to hand over all
  government power to Hitler as chancellor by passing the <i>Enabling
  Act</i>.

<p>The Nazis quickly used their new power to outlaw other parties,
  kill Communist Party supporters and leaders, and imprison or drive

  <p>Hitler vowed revenge for Germany's capitulation in the Great
    War. He began to rearm Germany and worked to expand the <i>Third
    Reich</i> to take over German-speaking lands that had been lost,
    and expand into neighboring territories.

    <p>By mid-1939, Germany had already conquered Austria and
    Czechoslovakia without firing a shot. Hitler's invasion of Poland,
    however, was fiercely resisted by the Poles and their allies
      Britain and France, leading to open warfare.</p>

    <p>While Germany's military <i lang="de">blitzkrieg</i> tactics were
    successful in conquering most of Europe, as for Napoleon the
    English Channel and the Russian Winter proved to be insurmountable
    obstacles. Reversals on the Eastern Front and the Allied invasions

  <p>Germany again suffered humiliation. Vast territories to the east
    were given to Poland and the Soviets, including old Prussia
    itself. Millions of Germans were expelled and forced to move into
    the new German borders.</p>

  <p>Rather than governing itself, Germany was placed under
    occupation by the four victorious allied powers. New German states
    were created and placed under American, British, French, and

  <p>Tensions between the Soviets and the western allies began to
    intensify. The Soviets stopped cooperating with the other allied
    powers, and attempted to force them out of their zones in Berlin by
    cutting off road and rail access.</p>

  <p>The allied powers also disagreed about what to do about Germany;
    the Soviets favored keeping Germany weak economically and thus
    militarily, while the western allies increasingly believed that
    repairing Germany's economy was the key to economic recovery in all
    of Europe.</p>

  <p>The western powers responded to the tensions with the Soviets by
    increasing their cooperation in their zones, introducing a new
    currency known as the <i lang="de">deutsche Mark</i> and encouraging the
    leaders of states in their zones to create a single civilian
    government for those German states not in the Soviet zone.

    <p>In 1949, this government was recognized by the allied powers as
      the <i>Federal Republic of Germany</i> or West Germany. The
      Soviets promptly set up a similar government in their zones of
      occupation, including the Soviet sector of Berlin, known as

  <p>The constitution of Germany is known in English as the <b>Basic

  <p>Germany is a <i>federal</i> state: the 16
      German states (<b lang="de">LÃ¤nder</b>) have extensive powers
      and can have substantially different laws from each other.

  <p>However, like Britain, Germany has a <i>parliamentary</i> system

    the <i>Interior Ministry</i>, which oversees the federal law
    enforcement agencies and the Office for Protection of the
    Constitution (<i lang="de">Verfassungsschutz</i>); the latter
    monitors extremist and anti-democratic groups, or groups suspected
    of having those tendencies.

  <p>The &ldquo;upper house&rdquo; of the German parliament is
    the <b lang="de">Bundesrat</b>. The <span lang="de">Bundesrat</span>
    has 68 members, who represent the 16 <span lang="de">LÃ¤nder</span>
    (each <span lang="de">Land</span> has 3&ndash;6 members).</p>

  <p>Although each <span lang="de">Land</span> has as many votes as

<p>Germany's <b>Federal Constitutional Court</b>
  (<i lang="de">Bundesverfassungsgericht</i>) is also very important
  politically; like the U.S. Supreme Court, it has the power to
  consider whether laws passed by the federal or state legislatures
  comply with the Basic Law.

<p>The Constitutional Court has 16 members, who are divided into two
  8-member panels (&ldquo;Senates&rdquo;) that consider cases
  independently to divide the court's workload.

<p>Unlike most of the other institutions of the federal government,
  which today are based in Berlin, the Constitutional Court meets in
  the city of <span lang="de">Karlsruhe</span>.</p>

<p>Unlike the UK, elections to the <span lang="de">Bundestag</span> use
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRQS_BbaP98"><i>mixed-member
      proportional representation</i></a> (MMP, also used
      in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uk44aykGg4">New
    Zealand</a>).</p>

<p>299 members are elected from single-member districts on a
  winner-takes-all basis using the &ldquo;first vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, at least 299 additional members are chosen from the
  various <i lang="de">LÃ¤nder</i> from party lists, to ensure each
  party's seats are proportional to the &ldquo;second vote.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parties must get at least 5% of the party list vote, or win at
    least one district, to get seats. Earning <i>list</i> seats
    requires 5% of the vote or winning three or more districts.</p>

  <p>In 2013, both the FDP and the AfD fell just short of the
    5% <i>threshold</i>, and neither party received seats as a
    result. Overall nearly 15% of second votes went to parties that
    didn't win seats.</p>

  <p>So while Germany's system is relatively proportional, it still
    gives some advantage to bigger parties. This is deliberately designed
    to reduce the risk of <i>extreme multipartism</i>.</p>

  <p>In the west, <i>denazification</i> mostly extended to Nazi
    leaders and those who been volunteers for the SS. When the Cold War
    set in, economic recovery was prioritized and the western powers
    needed experienced people to run West Germany, many of whom were
    party functionaries.</p>

  <p>In the east, the Nazi purge was more complete (since the
    communists were their bitter enemies); the official ideology
    treated the Nazis almost like a &ldquo;foreign power,&rdquo; so
    ordinary East Germans were absolved of guilt.</p>

  <p>Many Germans, even today, are unsure how to deal with the legacy
    of Nazism and the role of ordinary Germans in it.</p>

  <h2>German <i>Corporatism</i></h2>

  <p>During the Cold War era, Germany used a system for managing
    economic disputes between labor and management that is common in
    western Europe: <i>corporatism</i>.</p>

  <p>Under corporatism, the relationship between business and labor is
    based on negotiations between the two sides under government
    supervision. Negotiations are typically by <i>industry</i> rather
    than business (unlike union-management negotiations in
    America). The government then enforces the agreement.</p>

  <p>In Germany in particular, the law tends to give organized labor a
    bit more power than in Britain and America today.</p>

  <p>Like Britain, Germany has wrestled with trying to afford
    its <i>welfare state</i>. West Germany's businesses were never as
    weak as Britain's (in part because most were never nationalized),
    but increased competition has made it harder for Germany to
    compete in the global marketplace.</p>

  <p>Youth unemployment, in particular, is a major challenge; there
    aren't enough jobs being created, since German companies have
    turned to automation and off-shoring&mdash;including to the United
    States&mdash;to avoid expensive German labor costs.</p>
