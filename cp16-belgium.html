  <h2>Geography</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Belgium_relief_location_map.jpg" style="width: 40%" class="noborder" alt="Topographic map of Belgium">

  <p>The Kingdom of Belgium (<em lang="nl-BE">Koninkrijk Belgi√´</em> [Dutch];
    <em lang="fr-BE">Royaume de Belgique</em> [French];
    <em lang="de-BE">K√∂nigreich Belgien</em> [German]) is a country in
    western Europe, with a population of approximately 11 million. It
    is a little bit bigger than the U.S. state of Maryland.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Area currently known as Belgium was inhabited by Germanic
          tribes known as the <em>Belgae</em> during the era of Roman
          expansion.</p></li>
          
      <li><p>Annexed by Rome and governed as part of Gaul, eventually

  <h2>Early Middle Ages</h2>

  <p>Upon split of the Frankish kingdom in 843, area divided between
     West Francia (Charles the Bald) and Middle Francia (Lothair I).

  </p>
<p>Northern part of Middle Francia became <em>Lotharingia</em>,
    eventually divided itself.</p>
    
  <p>Fiefdoms in the region were ultimately divided between the nominal
    control of France and the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

  <h2>The Burgundian Netherlands</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Burgundian-possessions-in-the-low-countries.png" style="width: 35%; float: right" class="noborder" alt="Location of Burgundian Netherlands.">

  <p>Eventually most of the territories in the region, including
    the <em>County of Flanders</em> which historically had been under
    the suzerainty of the king of France, fell under the control of the
    duchy of Burgundy, ruled by the <strong>House of Valois</strong>, through
    intermarriage.</p>

  <p>They were subsequently inherited by the <strong>House of Habsburg</strong>,
    who also ruled Spain until 1700.</p>

  <p>In 1581, the northern, mostly Protestant provinces of the
    Burgundian Netherlands revolted against Habsburg rule, forming
    the <em>Dutch Republic</em>.

  </p>
<p>The southern provinces, which had remained Catholic, mostly
    remained under the control of the Habsburgs and became known as
    the ‚ÄúSpanish Netherlands.‚Äù This was the first
    territory to emerge whose borders correspond mostly with those of
    modern Belgium.</p>

  <p>After 1715, control passed to the Austrian branch of the Habsburg
    family and the area became known as the ‚ÄúAustrian
    Netherlands.‚Äù</p>

  <h2>Annexation by Revolutionary France</h2>

  <p>In 1794, the armies of revolutionary France invaded the
    Austrian Netherlands, along with the Dutch Republic and the
    <em>Prince-Bishopric of <span lang="fr">Li√®ge</span></em>.</p>

  <p>The Austrian Netherlands and <span lang="fr">Li√®ge</span> were
    annexed by France, while the decentralized Dutch Republic was
    replaced by the unitary <em>Batavian Republic</em> allied with
    France.</p>

  <p>The annexation was largely unpopular among the population, who
    had not been subject to the revolutionary fervor that had taken
    place in France over the past five years.</p>

       Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815-30)." class="noborder">
  
  <p>At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 (after
    Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, near Brussels), the
    Low Countries were reunited, with most of the territory becoming
    part of the <em>United Kingdom of the Netherlands</em> and the
    remainder forming the <em>Grand Duchy of Luxembourg</em>.</p>

  <p>Both the Netherlands and Luxembourg shared the same ruler, King
    William I (a <em>personal union</em>); the main difference was that
    Luxembourg was part of the German Confederation while the
    Netherlands was a fully independent state.</p>

  <p>The provinces of the new kingdom were generally based on
    the <em lang="fr">d√©partements</em> that had been established under
    French rule.</p>

  <h2>The Formation of Belgium</h2>

    <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Partition-plan-Talleyrand-en.svg" style="width: 30%; float: right" alt="Map of the
       Talleyrand Partition Plan." class="noborder">
  
  <p>In 1830, the southern, Catholic provinces seceded from the rest
    of the Netherlands after a brief uprising.

  </p>
<p>France favored splitting Belgium on linguistic lines. Britain
    feared French control of Antwerp and other ports.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the major European powers decided to allow Belgium to be
    formed as a unified ‚Äúbuffer state‚Äù between France, the
    Netherlands, and Prussia (later Germany).

  </p>
<p>The portion of Luxembourg where the population mostly
    spoke <em>Walloon</em> and other Romance languages was also ceded to
    Belgium.</p>

  <h2>The Belgian Monarchy</h2>

  <div style="float: right; width: 15%">
    <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Leopold_I_of_Belgium.jpg" alt="Leopold I" style="width: 100%">
    <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Leopold_ii_garter_knight.jpg" alt="Leopold II" style="width: 100%">
  </div>
  
   <p>In 1831, Leopold I‚Äîa German prince who was the uncle of
     the future Queen Victoria, then the heir to the British throne,
     and the widower of her cousin Charlotte‚Äîwas installed by
     the revolutionary assembly as the first King of the Belgians.</p>
   
  <p>Belgium was a constitutional monarchy who shared power with a
    parliament, although both Leopold I and his son Leopold II (king
    1865‚Äì1909) took a more active role in domestic politics than
    the British monarchs of the period did.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Wallonia and Flanders</h2>

  <p>Over time, the term <em>Flanders</em> (demonym <em>Fleming</em>;
    adjective: <em>Flemish</em>) became associated not just with the
    provinces of East and West Flanders, but with the broader region
    in the north of the country where various Dutch dialects were
    spoken by the bulk of the population. (Dutch is a Germanic
    language, as is English.)

  </p>
<p><em>Wallonia</em> (demonym and adjective: <em>Walloon</em>) similarly
    was applied beyond the area where Walloon was spoken. The term
    became associated with the south of the country, where the
    population generally spoke one of the Romance <em lang="fr">langues
    d'o√Øl</em> such as Picard and Walloon (both closely related to, but
    distinct from, French), along with areas in the southeast where
    Luxembourgish (another Germanic language) was spoken.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Belgium in the 19th Century</h2>

  <p>Belgium became a highly developed, industrialized country during
    the 19th century, although development in the south was
    substantially greater than in the more agrarian north.</p>

  <p>During the reign of Leopold II, universal male suffrage was
    introduced in 1893; Belgium was also the first country to adopt
    proportional representation in national elections.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The School War</h2>
  
  <p>Major dispute in Belgium in late 1800s was between liberals and
    Catholics over the role of religion in elementary schools: the
    ‚ÄúSchool War‚Äù:
    </p>
<ul>

      <li>1879: Liberals gain power; establish new, secular primary
        schools across Belgium.</li>

      <li>Boycott led by Catholic Church; Catholic elementary schools
        flourish despite no government funding.

      </li>
<li>1884: Catholic parties regain power; public funding of
        Catholic schools put in place.
        
    </li>
</ul>

  <h2>The Congo</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Kongovrijstaat.jpg" style="width: 30%; float: right" class="noborder" alt="Map of the Congo Free State">
  
  <p>Beyond Belgium, Leopold II aspired to control colonies in Africa
    or Asia. After failing to acquire the Philippines from Spain, he
    sponsored expeditions in Africa by British explorer Henry Morton
    Stanley that culminated in the establishment of the <strong>Congo Free
    State</strong> in 1885.

  </p>
<p>Leopold treated the Congo as his own personal fiefdom.  Officials
    and companies in the colony behaved with impunity.  The native
    peoples were subjected to forced labor in mines and on rubber
    plantations, resulting in millions of deaths.</p>

  <p>In the first decade of the 1900s, books written by Joseph
    Conrad and Arthur Conan Doyle publicized the atrocities taking place
    in the Congo, leading to international pressure for the Belgian
    government to step in. In 1908, Belgium took over control of
    the Congo Free State from Leopold II.

<section>

  <h2>Language in 19th Century Belgium</h2>

  <p>The language of the political elite, the government and courts,
    secondary and higher education, and business was almost
    exclusively French, even in areas where Germanic languages were
    dominant in the population.</p>

  <p>The dominance of French in state affairs led to complaints from
    the Dutch-speaking majority that they were second-class citizens
    in their own country. Legal reforms that put Dutch and French on
    an equal footing in government in the late 1800s had little effect
    in practice until well into the 20th century.

  </p>
<p>The language barrier may have also hindered the economic
    development of Flanders; except for the Brussels region, Flanders
    was substantially poorer than Wallonia until after World War II.
    
</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>World War I</h2>

    <img src="img/cp16-belgium/German_occupation_of_Belgium_1914-1916.jpg" style="width: 35%; float: right" class="noborder" alt="Map of areas of Belgium under German occupation in World War I.">
  
  <p>Early in World War I, Germany invaded neutral Belgium and
    Luxembourg to try to avoid the bulk of France's defenses, which
    were concentrated on their mutual border.

  </p>
<p>The invasion is the event that triggered British entry into the
    war; the UK had guaranteed to protect Belgium as a neutral buffer
    state in the treaty acknowledging Belgian independence in
    1839. Germany did not expect Britain to honor this commitment.

  </p>
<p>Most of Belgium was occupied by Germany throughout the war until
    Germany's surrender in 1918. After the war, Belgium annexed some
    small territories that had been part of Germany in the east.
    
</p></section>

<section>

  <h2>World War II</h2>

  <p>Like in World War I, Belgium was officially neutral. Again German
    plans were based on sweeping through Luxembourg and Belgium to
    attack France indirectly, avoiding the <em>Maginot Line</em> of
    defenses along the Franco-German border.</p>

  <p>In May 1940, the German <em>Blitzkrieg</em> quickly conquered
    Belgium. Against the advice of his government, King Leopold III,
    who had personally taken command of the army, surrendered to the
    Germans.

  </p>
<p>The government fled to Paris (and ultimately to London) and
    condemned Leopold as ‚Äúunfit to reign.‚Äù The king was
    imprisoned by the Germans and attempted to negotiate with Hitler
    to no avail.

  <h2>Leopold III in World War II</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Leopold_III_van_Belgie.jpg" style="width: 25%; float: right" class="noborder" alt="Leopold III of Belgium">

  <p>Leopold's actions in the war had been popular early on, but his
    failure to win concessions from the Germans, along with his
    decision not to criticize the German occupation, his criticism of
    the government-in-exile, and his remarriage in 1941 led to a
    decline in his domestic support.</p>

  <p>After D-Day in June 1944, the Germans took Leopold to Germany as
    their prisoner. The government, which returned from exile, chose
    the king's brother Prince Charles to serve as regent.</p>

  <p>Leopold was freed from German captivity by American forces in May
    1945, but did not return to Belgium as his actions had deeply
    divided the country.</p>

  <h2>The Royal Question</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Koningskwestie_kaart_met_percentage_voor-stemmen.png" style="width: 25%; float: right" class="noborder" alt="Results of
       1950 referendum on King Leopold III.">
  
  <p>To resolve the status of Leopold as king, in March 1950 the
    government organized a referendum on whether he ‚Äúshould
    resume the exercise of his constitutional powers.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Although 57.7% of the population voted in favor of the king's
    return to power, the country was deeply divided. In Brussels,
    just 48% of the population was in favor, while in Wallonia only 42%
    of voters favored the king resuming his duties.</p>

  <p>Leopold III returned to the country and resumed his position in
    July, which prompted a series of general strikes concentrated in
    Brussels, the port of Antwerp, and industrial areas of
    Wallonia. The country was paralyzed.</p>

  <p>The prospect of Wallonia seceding led Leopold to announce he
    would abdicate in favor of his son, Prince Baudouin, on August 1.
    King Baudouin took the throne on July 17, 1951.</p>

  <h2>International Cooperation</h2>

       outside the headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels.">

  <p>After World War II, Belgium rejected neutrality and instead
    became a key proponent of European cooperation and integration.

    </p>
<ul>
      <li>1948: Benelux Customs Union (now just the Benelux
        Union).
      </li>
<li>1949: North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
      </li>
<li>1951‚Äì52: European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC).
      </li>
<li>1957‚Äì58: European Economic Community (EEC) and
        European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom).
      </li>
<li>1993: Agreements on Common Foreign and Security Policy and
        police/judicial cooperation.
      </li>
<li>1995: Schengen Agreement enters into force.
      </li>
<li>1999: Euro established; physical currency
        circulates from 2002.

</ul>
    
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Language Politics</h2>

  <p>Beginning with the formation of the state, the capital Brussels
    and its suburbs in southern Flanders, historically a
    Dutch-speaking region, gradually became <em>Francized</em>; as
    French was the <em>prestige language</em> in government and
    business.

  </p>
<p>Similarly, in Wallonia, the use of French effectively replaced
    the use of Picard, Walloon, and other languages outside the home;
    this was a less politically controversial change, given that both
    languages are substantially similar to French.

  </p>
<p>From 1932, a language census was established to decide official
    language of each municipality (based on local majority: French,
    Dutch, or German). Also decided where <em>language facilities</em>
    would be provided (areas where 30% of people spoke French or
    Dutch). Municipalities without language facilities would be
    monolingual, except the capital city (Brussels).</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Stemming the Tide</h2>

  <p>Continued Francization of Brussels' suburbs led to Flemish
    boycott of 1960 language census and, in 1962, freezing the
    language areas that were set based on the 1947 census.</p>

  <p>To reduce Francization, Dutch speakers were not allowed to send
    their children to Francophone schools (and vice versa) in
    bilingual areas from 1962 to 1971.

  </p>
<p>Improvement in the prestige of Dutch, along with changes in the
    Belgian economy in favor of Flanders, has somewhat reduced
    Francization. However, immigrants tend to favor French over Dutch
    and Brussels has become almost exclusively francophone.
    
</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>State Reform in Belgium</h2>

  <p>Conflict over linguistic issues reached a peak in 1968 when
    protests brought down the Belgian government after a dispute over
    instruction in French at the Catholic University of Leuven, which
    is located in a predominantly Dutch-speaking community east of
    Brussels.
    
  </p>
<p>The new government began a process of <em>state reform</em>: a
    series of measures, generally involving changes to the national
    constitution, that has transformed Belgium since 1970 from a
    centralized, unitary state into a highly decentralized state with
    relatively few shared national institutions.

  </p>
<p>There have been six rounds of state reform to date; the most
    recent reform took place in 2011.
    
</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>National Institutions</h2>

  <p>The major institutions of the national government of Belgium are:

    </p>
<ul>
      <li>The Monarch (head of state).
      </li>
<li>The Government (executive and head of government).
      </li>
<li>The Parliament (legislature).
      </li>
<li>The Judiciary.
    </li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Monarchy</h2>

    <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Prins_Filip.jpg" style="width: 25%; float: right;" alt="Philippe, king of the Belgians">
  
  <p>The current king is King Philippe, who took the throne in July
    2013 upon the abdication of his father, King Albert II, due to ill
    health.

  </p>
<p>By convention, the king is expected to be ‚Äúabove
    politics‚Äù in public; his major political responsibilities
    either are delegated to others or can only be exercised with the
    countersignature of a government minister.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Politics of the Monarchy</h2>
 
  <p>Since the succession of King Baudouin in 1951, the only major
    controversy involving the king's powers involved Baudouin's
    refusal to sign into law legalizing abortion in 1990; at
    Baudouin's request, he was declared (temporarily) unable to reign
    for a day and the members of the government gave Royal Assent to
    the bill in his stead.

  </p>
<p>Monarchs also have the power to preside over meetings of the
    Council of Ministers (the cabinet), but none have exercised this
    power since the 1950s.

  </p>
<p>Belgian kings may also have substantial influence over the
    formation of governments by their choices
    of <em lang="fr">informateurs</em> and <em lang="fr">formateurs</em>.

<section>
  <h2>The Federal Government</h2>

    <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Charles_Michel_UNDP_2010.jpg" style="width: 20%; float: right;" alt="Charles Michel, prime minister of Belgium">

  <p>In practice, the government is led by a <em>prime minister</em>
    along with a cabinet of 14 other ministers and other supporting
    ministers outside the cabinet; half of the ministers (other than
    the prime minister) must be from each language group.

  </p>
<p>Since October 2014, the prime minister has
    been <span lang="fr">Charles Michel</span> of the Francophone
    liberal <em lang="fr">Mouvement R√©formateur</em> (MR) party. Other
    coalition parties:

    </p>
<ul>
      <li>The conservative-Flemish
        nationalist <em lang="nl">Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie</em> (N-VA;
        New Flemish Alliance).
      </li>
<li>The Flemish Christian Democrats
        (<em lang="nl">Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams</em>, CD&amp;V;
        Christian Democratic and Flemish).
      </li>
<li>The Flemish liberal <em lang="nl">Open
          Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten</em> (Open Vld; Open Flemish
          Liberals and Democrats).</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Government Formation in Belgium</h2>

  <p>The complexity of forming coalition governments in Belgium
    has led to a multi-stage process.</p>

  <p>Typically the monarch appoints an elder statesman as
    an <em lang="fr">informateur</em> who meets with leaders of the
    various parties to identify possible coalitions and then reports
    back to the monarch. The king then decides whether to allow
    someone to attempt to form a government, or whether further
    discussions are required (which may result in the king appointing
    a new informateur).</p>

  <p>Once the king is satisfied someone (typically a party leader) is
    capable of forming a government supported by a majority of MPs, he
    or she is appointed as a <em lang="fr">formateur</em>‚Äîa
    presumptive prime minister‚Äîand begins formal negotiations
    with other parties on forming a cabinet and establishing a
    legislative program.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>More on Government Formation</h2>

  <p>When an agreement is reached, the formateur is officially
    appointed by the king as the prime minister, heading a cabinet of
    15 ministers.</p>

  <p>As it can take a long time for a government to be formed, the
    previous government remains in office as a <em>caretaker
    government</em> until the new government is ready to take
    office. By convention caretaker governments can only act to
    continue the day-to-day operations of the country or (in an
    emergency) after consultation with all of the major parties.</p>

  <p>The longest a caretaker government has served was after the 2010
    election; it took 541 days to form a government due to conflicts
    over voting rights in elections in the
    former <em>Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde</em> parliamentary
    constituency.</p>

  <h2>The Federal Parliament</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Palais_de_la_Nation.jpg" style="float: right; width: 40%" alt="Facade of the Palace of the Nation in Brussels.">
  
  <p>The Belgian Federal Parliament comprises two chambers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Chamber of Representatives.
      </li>
<li>The Senate.
    </li>
</ul>

  <p>Both chambers meet in separate wings of the <strong>Palace of the

  <h2>The Chamber of Representatives</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Chambre_Belgique_interieur.jpg" style="float: right; width: 25%" class="noborder" alt="Interior of the Chamber of Representatives.">

  <p>The Chamber of Representatives includes 150 members, elected by
    proportional representation.</p>
  
  <p>Since the <em>Sixth State Reform</em> in 2011, which took effect at
    the 2014 federal elections, the ten provinces, along with the
    Brussels-Capital Region, are each a constituency for the Chamber
    of Representatives. The number of seats allocated to each
    constituency is based on its share of the national population in
    the most recent census.</p>

  <p>To win seats in a constituency, a party (or joint list of
    parties) must receive at least 5% of the constituency-wide vote
    for its list and/or candidates.</p>

  <h2>Dual Mandates and Cabinet Responsibility</h2>

  <p>As in France, sitting MPs may not serve as government ministers;
    although almost all of the government ministers will have been
    elected on their party list, they must resign from Parliament and
    the first candidate on their party list from their constituency
    who did not gain a seat replaces them. This is also true for
    Belgium's subnational parliaments.

  </p>
<p>Also, MPs may only serve in one of the directly-elected
    parliaments; in the event of a conflict, the same procedure
    applies. (Parties often list party leaders and other popular
    candidates on ballots for multiple parliaments to build support
    for their list.)

  </p>
<p>The cabinet is solely responsible to the Chamber of
    Representatives and must retain its confidence.

  <h2>Consociationalism</h2>

  <p>The chamber is divided into two language groups based on the
    theory of <em>consociationalism</em> developed by Dutch political
    scientist <span lang="nl">Arend Lijphart</span>.
    
  </p>
<p>Members elected from the provinces in the Flemish Region are part
    of the Dutch language group, while members from Wallonia are part
    of the French language group.  Those elected from Brussels are
    assigned to the language group corresponding to the language they
    take the oath of office in.

</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>Voting by Language Groups</h2>

  <p>Laws that affect the powers of the regions and communities, as
    well as laws that would alter the ‚Äúlanguage border,‚Äù
    must be approved by a majority of both language groups.</p>

  <p>In practice this means that coalitions need to command not just a
    majority of the 150-member chamber but also a majority of members
    from each language group if they must alter community or regional
    powers as part of their program.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Consociationalism Elsewhere</h2>
  
  <p>A similar consociational system is used in the Northern Ireland
    Assembly; however, they can choose their group affiliation, more
    matters are potentially subject to cross-group agreement, and the
    groups are based on religious communities (Protestant, Catholic,
    or nonsectarian) rather than language.

  </p>
<p>Similar systems have been proposed or implemented in other
    societies with deep cultural, ethnic, or religious divisions,
    including Bosnia and Cyprus, with mixed success.
    
</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>Open List Proportional Representation</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Bulletin_de_vote_communales_2012_Walcourt.jpg" alt="Example ballot from a local election in Belgium." style="float: right; width: 35%">
  
  <p>Belgium uses an <em>open list</em> proportional representation
    system where voters can either cast a vote for a party <em>or</em>
    express a preference for one or more individual candidates from
    that party (the party still only gets one vote overall). In
    a <em>closed list</em> system, voters <em>only</em> vote for a party
    and cannot affect the ordering of the list.
    
  </p>
<p>In Belgium, candidates on the list who receive individual
    preferences accounting for more than half of the total votes
    necessary for their party to gain a seat (the
    <em>quota</em>) are ‚Äúbumped up‚Äù to the top of the list,
    in order of the number of individual votes they get. This can
    result in candidates ranked higher than them by the party being
    bumped down and not getting a seat.
    
</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>The Senate</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Senat_Belgique_interieur.jpg" style="width: 35%" class="noborder" alt="Interior of the Belgian Senate chamber.">

  <p>The Senate is the upper house of the Belgian Federal
    Parliament. Originally, as was the case of most upper houses, it
    had equal power with the Chamber of Representatives. Over the past
    few decades, its powers have been reduced considerably, although
    both chambers must still consent to constitutional amendments,
    treaties, and state reform laws.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Composition of the Senate</h2>

  <p>Since the Sixth State Reform in 2011, the Senate has no longer
    been directly elected. Instead, 50 senators are appointed from the
    membership of the community and regional parliaments (from within
    their own membership), with seats allocated to parties based on
    the results of the federal Chamber of Representatives
    election. These senators remain members of their community and/or
    regional parliament(s).

  </p>
<p>After they are chosen, 10 additional <em>co-opted</em> senators are
    selected (six by the Dutch-language group and four by the
    French-language group).

</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>The Legal System and Judiciary</h2>

  <p>Belgium has a civil law legal system, modeled after that of
    France. Unlike the rest of the political system, the courts have
    not gone through the state reform process and thus the judiciary
    remains an exclusively federal responsibility.

  </p>
<p>The highest court for most matters is the <strong>Court of
      Cassation</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>In 1980 a <strong>Constitutional Court</strong> was established to
    arbitrate disputes over the powers assigned by the Constitution to
    the national and subnational governments; it also has the power to
    protect individual rights and freedoms by declaring laws and
    actions to be unconstitutional.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Belgian Federalism Today</h2>

  <p>The process of state reform in Belgium has resulted in a complex
    structure of entities at the subnational level:

    </p>
<ul>
      <li>
<em>Communities</em>, based on language and culture.
      </li>
<li>
<em>Regions</em>, based on territory.
      </li>
<li>
<em>Provinces</em>, political subdivisions of the regions of
        Flanders and Wallonia.
      </li>
<li>
<em>Municipalities</em>, political subdivisions of the
        provinces and Brussels-Capital Region.
    </li>
</ul>
    
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Communities</h2>

  <p>In 1970, the <em>First State Reform</em> established
      three <em>cultural communities</em> based on language. They gained
      additional powers in the <em>Second State Reform</em> of 1980 and
    became known as <em>communities</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The Flemish Community (originally known as the Dutch Cultural
        Community).</p></li>
      <li><p>The French Community, which also uses the controversial
        name <em>Wallonia-Brussels Federation</em>.
      </p></li>
<li><p>The German-speaking Community.
    </p></li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>

  <h2>Community Governments</h2>

  <p>Each community has a unicameral parliament, along with a
    government responsible to it headed by a <em>Minister-President</em>.</p>

  <p>The Flemish Community and German Community parliaments are
    directly elected via open list proportional representation.</p>
  
  <p>The French Community's parliament consists of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
<p>75 members representing Wallonia, who are the Francophone
      members of the Walloon Parliament, along with French-speaking
        replacements for any German-speaking Walloon MPs.</p>
    </li>
<li>
<p>19 members of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital
        Region, chosen by the French-speaking members of that
        parliament.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Community Powers and Structure</h2>
    
  <p>The communities have powers over education, culture and the media,
    health policy, and social assistance programs (except cash
    benefits).

  </p>
<p>The communities exercise these powers only in geographic areas
    they control: the Flemish (Dutch-speaking) Community only has
    power in Flanders and Brussels, the French Community operates in
    most of Wallonia and Brussels, and the German-speaking Community
    operates in the portion of Wallonia annexed from Germany by
    Belgium in 1920.</p>

  <p>The French and Flemish communities are both headquartered in Brussels;
    the German-speaking community's capital is Eupen in the
    northeastern province of Li√®ge.

</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>Language Facilities</h2>

  <p>27 municipalities that have a sizable population
    speaking a minority language (Dutch, French, or German, depending
    on the municipality) have <em>language facilities</em>; in these
    areas, the community must finance nursery schools and elementary
    schools in that language as well.

  </p>
<p>Public officials in 24 of these municipalities are also
    required to communicate with citizens in one of the minority
    languages if requested.</p>

  <p>All of the municipalities in the German-speaking Community have
    French language facilities; 12 municipalities in the Flemish
    Community surrounding Brussels also have French language facilities.

  </p>
<p>Except in the Brussels region, government institutions are
    otherwise monolingual, including road signs and announcements on
    trains and buses. Since most places have different names in
    Dutch, French, and German, this can be very confusing.
    
</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>Communities in Brussels</h2>
    
  <p>Within the Brussels-Capital Region, which is officially bilingual
    and part of the territory of both the Flemish and French communities,
    citizens are served by the Flemish or French community in
    educational and cultural matters: separate schools and media are
    operated or regulated by each community.

  </p>
<p>Health care and social assistance programs are directed by a
    shared Common Community Commission.

  </p>
<p>The French-speaking and Dutch-speaking members of the Parliament
    of the Brussels-Capital Region serve on the assemblies of their
    respective community commissions; all also serve on the United
    Assembly of the Common Community Commission.</p>
    
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Regions</h2>
  
  <p>Three <strong>regions</strong> were created in the <em>Second</em> and <em>Third State
      Reforms</em>:

    </p>
<ul>
      <li>The Flemish Region or <em>Flanders</em> (1980).
      </li>
<li>The Walloon Region or <em>Wallonia</em> (1980).
      </li>
<li>The Brussels-Capital Region (1989): the city of Brussels
        proper, along with 18 neighboring municipalities.
    </li>
</ul>

  <p>The regions have responsibility for all matters that are not
    administered by the communities or by the national
    government. These competencies include agriculture, economic
    regulation, non-nuclear energy, environmental policy, foreign
    trade, housing, and most forms of transportation, as well as
    regulating municipalities and provinces.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Regional Parliaments and Governments</h2>
  
  <p>The political institutions of the Flemish Region were merged with
    those of the Flemish Community; they share the same parliament and
    government. However, members elected by voters in Brussels are not
    allowed to vote on issues that are exclusively <em>regional</em>
    powers.</p>

  <p>The Walloon Region and Brussels-Capital Region each have their
    own, separate parliaments which are directly elected by open list
    proportional representation, and each has a distinct government
    accountable to them headed by a Minister-President as well.

  </p>
<p>In the Brussels-Capital Region, citizens can vote for
    representatives of one language group; 17 of 89 seats are reserved
    for the Dutch-speaking constituency.

</p></section>


<section>
  <h2>Provinces</h2>

  <img src="img/cp16-belgium/Provinces_of_Belgium_with_CoA-en.svg" alt="Map of the provinces of Belgium." style="float: right; width: 35%" class="noborder">
  
  <p>The Flemish and Walloon Regions are divided into five provinces each:

      <ul style="list-style-type: none">
        <li>Antwerp

</ul>
    </div>
    
  <p style="clear: both">Except for the abolition of the unified
    province of Brabant in 1995, these are essentially the same
    provinces that broke away from the Netherlands in 1830.

</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>Provincial Governments and Powers</h2>
  
  <p>Each province has an elected council and a governor appointed by
    the <em>regional</em> government, who heads the provincial
    government along with deputies chosen by the provincial
    council.</p>


  <p>Today the provinces have responsibilities delegated by the
    regional governments. Since the Brussels-Capital Region does not
    have any provinces, the regional government takes on those
    responsibilities.

</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>Remaining Federal Powers</h2>

  <p>Even by comparison to other federal states, the remaining powers of
    the national government are very limited:
  
  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Military and foreign policy (except trade).
    </li>
<li>Nuclear energy.
    </li>
<li>Federal police.
    </li>
<li>The judiciary.
    </li>
<li>Managing public finances and the national debt.
    </li>
<li>Social security (income support) benefits.
    </li>
<li>Operating state-owned companies (notably the Belgian
      Railways [SNCB] and the National Lottery).
  </li>
</ul>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>European Parliament Elections</h2>

  <p>Belgium is divided into three constituencies for electing members
    of the European Parliament:

    </p>
<ul>
      <li>The Dutch-speaking electoral college (Flanders and Brussels).
      </li>
<li>The French-speaking electoral college (Wallonia and Brussels).
      </li>
<li>The German-speaking electoral college (territory of the
        German-speaking community).
    </li>
</ul>

  <p>In Brussels and the 6 municipalities with language facilities
    neighboring Brussels, citizens can vote in either the
    Dutch-speaking or French-speaking constituency. Similarly, in the
    territory of the German-speaking community, voters can choose
    between the French and German ballots.

</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>Political Parties</h2>

  <p>Until the 1960s, Belgian political parties were organized on
    ideological and religious lines. The dominant parties were:

    </p>
<ul>
      <li>The Catholic Party, which after World War II became the
        Christian Democrats.
      </li>
<li>The Liberal Party.
      </li>
<li>The Labour Party, which evolved into the Socialist Party
        after World War II.
    </li>
</ul>

    <p>In the 1960s, each of these parties split into linguistic
      factions. In addition, the rise in environmental issues led to the
      emergence of Green parties, while other parties emerged based
      solely on language-based populist nationalism.
